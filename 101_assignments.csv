Just a reminder that, throughout this class, we will be utilizing a format of ""preflection, attend, reflection"" that will bookend each week, mimicking the best practices derived from educational research. The model we pull from is: 



Preview
Attend
Review
Study
Assess



This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this week and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.
OBJECTIVES



Respond critically to readings and writers

In the final week of each unit, we will have a ""Design Week."" This is a week where you get to... design your Unit Portfolio. If you have kept up with your work all unit, this week will be cake for you. You've already both drafted and revised your documents. Now, you get to utilize your peers and instructor's previous feedback to refine your work, gather additional feedback to ensure that you've put forth your best effort, and begin thinking about how to create a portfolio that accentuates the great things about the work that you've developed over the last several weeks.
As a reminder, your professor, your Lab Instructor, and your classmates are your BEST RESOURCES, so USE THEM! And in using them, make sure to be clear about what, exactly, you need out of that interaction. For that purpose, below is a reminder of Elbow and Belanoff's ""Ways of Responding"" that can help guide you in gathering the best possible feedback for your writing. As a reminder, when you are working with your peers, make sure to always ask ""what type of response do you feel would be most helpful for you, so that I can structure my reading of your piece?"" or to provide direction in the form of letting them know what type of feedback that you would like to receive.

I've surely said this before in class, but Design Days in the weeks leading up to a portfolio work best when they are loud. When there is lots of movement as students go back and forth between each other seeking feedback, asking questions about the assignments, ""tell me what you think when you see this feedback Aaron gave me?"" ""I'm trying to do this but I'm a little bit stuck. Have you done something like this before?"" ""I'm going for a sort of gleeful energy here with the colors and structure. Does that come across?""
One of the things that should be happening most prominently in this clamor of writing activity (the best type of writing) is receiving feedback. And in order to receive effective feedback, you need to know how to ask for feedback that will be helpful to you. To do that, we will review Elbow and Belanoff's piece, ""Summary of Ways of Responding.""

We have been working through this research assignment for about a week now, and it has become time for us to begin moving from the data collection stage into the actual recording stage. You have been working either in opposition to or directly from a problem that you stated you wished to solve in your community, and have been through a Learning and Discovery process, including creating a research question, reflecting on assets in your community, and then looking to who else in your community or elsewhere has been attempting to solve this or other similar problems. You have created am Annotated Bibliography  to help you identify gaps in your research and provide a framework upon which it could proceed. And, you've begun the process of rearranging what you've placed into your annotated bibliography, as well as some of the quotations from those resources, which helped you hopefully see a narrative of those resources taking shape. Now, it is time to record that in a way that can guide your reader through these resources to see why you are going to tackle the problem the way you are.
You can (and should!) use our Genre Analysis toolkit that we talked about in class- looking at models of literature reviews, looking up templates for literature reviews, and seeing what commonalities exist that show you what a literature review IS and how you might be able to write one of your own. You should also utilize the Writing Center and your Lab Instructor in this process!
Remember, you have the They Say/I Say book to help you out with how to introduce and develop your sources and the connections between them, and our collaboratively developed Literature Review Template!!!
TASK
You will create a LITERATURE REVIEW for a paper (requirements for full paper below). This literature review will synthesize resources into a narrative that will:

Dive DIRECTLY into your sources. It could begin with a couple sentences like ""Many over the years have looked to solve the problem of X. For instance, in 2011, X looked at...""
Include at least 4 sources, including at least one scholarly and one ""popular,"" and potentially including primary sources
Demonstrate that this problem exists in your community and the community is interested in finding a solution
Refer directly to assets that can be helpful in finding a solution to the problem
Demonstrates that others have looked to solve similar problems in other places, or perhaps in your community, that can be helpful in knowing how to go about solving this problem
SYNTHESIZE your sources through an organizational structure that makes sense to a reader and builds a story of others' approach to this problem or similar problems. This means focusing on how these resources work TOGETHER rather than independently to tell this story.
Clearly work toward developing an understanding of the problem and potential solutions to the problem
Include all references cited in MLA format and with an MLA Works Cited at the end of the document

This should be similar to your Re-Mix in that you are using concepts from your resources to BUILD A NARRATIVE from the different resources you've discovered.
Your literature review WILL NOT:

Have an introduction of ANY KIND.
Include YOUR VOICE. 
Simply be a LIST of your resources sounding like ""in this source they say"" and then ""in this source they say"" and finally ""in this source they say."" . 
Draw any conclusions

 
 
 
*****DO NOT DO ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE. IT IS INCLUDED ONLY FOR REFERENCE*****
Below, find the description for the full assignment.
You will create a minimum four-page research paper that will adhere to the following guidelines:



The writing must seek to introduce, and then provide some at least partial solution to, a problem that you see in your ""home"" that you plan to take an active part in.
The writing must include reference to ""assets"" that this community has, and seek to utilize them within the solution
The writing must include references to ""needs"" that this community has and how they relate to the problem/solution
The writing must demonstrate the ways that you will be involved in implementing this solution. This should be a realistic solution to a problem that you have the capacity to be a part of the change. And you can be a part of solving huge problems, if you can identify your role in solving them.
The writing must demonstrate the ways that research will be an ongoing component of discovering and implementing your solution. See the Action Research and/or Narrative Inquiry videos earlier for guides on what these research processes can look like, and ""The Advocate"" for a model on what this can look like in practice out in the real world.
The writing must include a minimum of four citations in MLA format, following the guidelines below:

A minimum of one scholarly citation such as a journal article, book, or study
A minimum of one CREDIBLE popular citation such as a newspaper article, newscast or some other credible form of collecting and distributing information with the community.
Encouraged inclusion of primary resources such as interviews with community members, direct observations, tweet by a neighbor, Facebook post from a community page or someone directly impacted or working on the problem, etc.





The writing's format must adhere to the following guidelines:



Begin with an Introduction that will inform the reader of what types of information they are about to read, characterizes the community and their assets/needs, etc.
Include a discussion of the problem that identifies the problem itself and how it manifests within the community. This should emerge directly from your research question and include citations that help the reader to understand the problem and its context.
Include a discussion of the solution that identifies the actions the author will take, personally and communally, to help to resolve the problem, how you are involved, and how research can play an ongoing role in the solution.
End with a conclusion that wraps up the big ideas and helps the reader to understand the totality of the writing
Be in MLA format

As we are working on our research writing and discussions of research, I don't want us to lose sight of the work that we've been doing all semester with focusing on really critical things like home and specificity and structure and language choices. For that reason, while we're working on your research project, we will also be continuing to read a novel by Maurice Broaddus with a strong theme of home, especially for characters who are, objectively, very far from the place that they have always called home. 
This reading will be sort of a model text for us. We will look at the ways that Broaddus uses his characters and their relationships to explore these concepts of home, we will see the ways he utilizes specificity, structure and language in this exploration. And we'll see the ways that he employs distinct rhetorical choices to accomplish various purposes within the text, and occasionally take some time to sit back, take a break from the hustle and bustle, and just discuss our reading and how it relates to our discussions of our writing.

You've now reviewed your peers' work, and had them review yours. Hopefully, you've had enough time to complete the Peer Review Sheet and share it with them, and they you. Now, we have to figure out what to do with that feedback to create a more effective, revised piece. What are those ways that you can ""go for the jugular"" in your writing, as our previous reading suggests? 
This reading, from the blog Writing Power, provides some concrete things that you can focus on in your revision process to ensure that your writing continues to develop from smart revisions, rather than the spinning wheel of never-ending, meaningless difference. You want to take the feedback that you've received from your peers and be laser focused on how that feedback can inform substantive and rhetorically sound changes that will help you to more effectively communicate with your chosen audience.
To do that, you can focus on many things. However, the three we are going to focus on here are Audience, Purpose and Organization and/or Focus. When you're reading this piece, keep the feedback that you received from your peer in mind. How can the feedback you received be framed by these ideas? How can you better focus your topic, how can you organize your writing to make it clearer or more powerful, how can your purpose be clearer? And how can you more effectively achieve that purpose for your audience... or, how can you alter or reimagine your audience to better achieve that purpose?

This week, we're focusing on working toward a more ""final"" version of our ""Home That Built Me"" drafts. And one part of that which is exactly 0% fun but also very important for you to understand is citation styles. This is probably my least favorite part of academic writing, and I'd imagine perhaps your as well, but the histories of these citation styles are important in understanding why they have emerged as they have.
It comes from the era of the moveable type. Assigning credits in academic work was always something people were concerned about, and for a while it was typically done in a wide variety of ways, in pen, sort of on the fly. ""Narrative"" citations were the norm for the most part, having to include all the information you were trying to cite within your writing itself. This practice goes back to our first ever known linguist, Panini, who we also know was not the first linguist because he cited the work of others before him whose work we do not have records for. However, in 1891 Chicago University recognized that, in order for them to properly file and then search for the work of scholars within their filing systems, some sort of uniformity was necessary. So, they created the first ever citation style guide- The Chicago Style Manual- released in 1891.
Each citation style emerged from this original, with updates each few years to keep up with different mediums, new technology, new potential sources of scholarly information, etc. Citation styles, currently, are working to straddle the line between recognizing that most writing now is housed in digital formats (which could, conceivably, be cited much more effectively through a simple hyperlink) and recognizing that there are still print-only sources and print-only journals where scholars need to be able to credit their influences.
Citation styles also have different priorities based on the disciplines in which they are predominantly used. APA, for instance, is used most commonly in Psychology and other Health and Biological Sciences. Because of the way the scientific method works, we are constantly discovering new information, clarifying and debunking old ideas, etc. For this reason, the year of the publication is very important, and therefore goes alongside the author(s) in the in-text citation and near the front of a citation in the references section at the end of the document. It was also historically organized in file cabinets, and may need to be accessed quickly for assistance in diagnosing or treating patients in a clinical setting or during a lab using live animals where timelines are tight- so the running head allowed for quickly thumbing through documents to find the one you needed. MLA, on the other hand, is more often used in literature where the subject of study's age can vary greatly with no impact on the value of the scholarship. This means that the date of the scholarship comes far after the other crucial information such as what publisher or version the scholar is working from, and the page number is most important to note in the in-text citation. 
Knowing the ways these citation styles assign their values and why they are built the way they are is important to understanding why we even do this thing in academia and writing in general. Attribution is important, and guiding your reader to be able to understand the sources you have pulled from and be able to navigate back to them if they need to verify critical information about your use of that source.
So, while citations may be one of the worst parts of writing, it's still something that you do need to know. Not just because academics say so, but because they serve several very specific purposes and are designed by people who know what they're doing, know this history and know the needs of the discipline in order to design the best possible way to record the necessary information.

Aaron Wilder,Optional Assignment: Writing Center Visit,0.0,0,0,2022-11-14 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
While I know that all of you are in the Writing Lab and receiving regular feedback and conversations about the class and your writing from your Writing Lab Instructor, as we've learned in class, it is equally important to get different feedback and different perspectives. So, as an opportunity for bonus points, you have this assignment to go to the Writing Center for an appointment, and report back on your experience. 
The Writing Center does similar things that your writing lab will. They will get to know you a little bit, ask some critical questions, find the places where your writing shines, and then work with you on any places where you feel that your writing (ideas/concepts, rhetorical choices, word choices, organization, formatting etc.) can continue to grow. The writing center can work with you from the very beginning of a project, such as when you have a prompt coming up and you want to make sure that you understand it, all the way to the end when you need that last pair of eyes on it. The only difference is that in the ""walk-in"" writing center, you will do this with a fellow student rather than an M.A.-weilding instructor.
You may feel that this will be less beneficial- but the research shows that it is not, in fact. It is simply different. Much the way we've talked about how you all have knowledge that is accessible to you that is valuable that may not necessarily be considered so all the time (like fluency in AAVE or Appalachain English or ""Hick"" as some of you have referred to Southern English), that knowledge is indispensable in some situations. You'll find that your peers will have a lot of that type of knowledge because they are also students who are having to navigate very similar contexts to you. That will give the two of you abilities to better problem-solve together, as co-learners, for these assignments. 
So don't expect your tutors to take charge of the appointments. Go in with an idea of what you'd like to accomplish, and then negotiate with them how you want to approach this co-learning moment for the best of your benefit in this writing project.

As we are working on our revisions, I don't want us to lose sight of the work that we've been doing all semester with focusing on really critical things like home and specificity and structure and language choices. For that reason, while we're working on your research project, we will also be continuing to read a novel by Maurice Broaddus with a strong theme of home, especially for characters who are, objectively, very far from the place that they have always called home. 
This reading will be sort of a model text for us. We will look at the ways that Broaddus uses his characters and their relationships to explore these concepts of home, we will see the ways he utilizes specificity, structure and language in this exploration. And we'll see the ways that he employs distinct rhetorical choices to accomplish various purposes within the text, and occasionally take some time to sit back, take a break from the hustle and bustle, and just discuss our reading and how it relates to our discussions of our writing.

Aaron Wilder,Introduction: What do you want your classmates to know about you?,2.0,0.0019102196752626551,0.028653295128939826,2022-01-10 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSENow that you've learned a little bit about me, I'd like you to tell everyone something about you. We are building a small community in our class, and that requires us to communicate with each other, problem-solve together, and share things as a group. And while I spent a couple of hours typing up that introduction and adding hyperlinks etc., I don't want you all to spend that kind of time on this. Instead, I want you to do it off-the-cuff and real. I want you to create a 2 minute long intro video that gives me and your class mates a sneak peek into who you are.TASKCreate a video between 1 and 2 minutes long that introduces you to your classmates and share it in the discussion board below. If you aren't sure how to do this, there is a really slick online tool called Screencast-o-matic that can really help you out. I have a paid subscription to it because I use it so much, but it's available for free and you won't lose out on any quality in the content you make. If you like another way of making videos, you can use that too, of course. This video should provide some insight into ways that you identify that you are comfortable sharing with the class- identities such as ""an athlete"" or ""a student"" or ""nerd,"" a ""man,"" ""woman,"" or ""nonbinary,"" as ""Black,"" ""Latino,"" or ""white,"" as ""LGBTQ"" etc. etc. Anything that you feel embodies the ""you"" that you want to share with the class. This video should also include some key information about a place that you think of as ""home,"" which doesn't have to be the physical place where you have laid your head at night, but can be the places that are most valuable to you and helped to make you who you are today. Finally, it should include some kind of interesting story from your past that you feel helps to embody who you are. Think about ways to make these videos radiate your personality, and how to connect with your audience. If you're bubbly and happy, put something bright and colorful in your background and make sure to have your best bubbly voice and face on for recording. If you feel as if you're a hard worker, maybe take the video of you while you're nose-deep into the grindstone and end with ""but now I've gotta get back to work."" And if you think your audience is going to respond better to ""Now Imma get back on the grind. We OUT,"" you should sign off that way rather than with the previous version. Do what is gonna help your audience understand you.If you feel like you need an icebreaker formula, you can use the one below:What is your name?What is some community or 'label' that you identify with? What is a place I call home, and what is something about that place that I know that either very few people, or no one else in the world, knows? Tell a story that relates to that factoid.If I could choose anywhere on the planet to be right now, where would I be?OBJECTIVESCreate voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasionUses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes"
Aaron Wilder,Schedule First One-on-One Meeting with Aaron,5.0,0.004775549188156638,0.07163323782234958,2022-08-31 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
One of the best things about a writing class at Marian University is that we prioritize one-on-one interaction with you as writers and as people. In that way, I hope to get to know you as an individual that I can know not only know as a student, but as a person. I hope by some point in this class that we have built a positive relationship that involves trust, understanding and an affinity for exploring the ideas that you love and vibe with through writing. In order to do that, though, I need to meet with you one-on-one rather than in a group of a half-dozen or more. This is the first step in that process.
TASK
You will use this link to schedule this appointment. Make sure to choose my name when you're looking to schedule the time. If the link does not work for you for whatever reason, you should use Microsoft Outlook to schedule a one-on-one meeting with me in my office, Faculty C, in the Mother Theresa Hackelmeier Memorial Library (second floor, right above the writing center). A quick tutorial about how to schedule an online appointment can be found here. Ignore the part about including a TEAMS meeting... we will be meeting in person.
HOW YOU'LL BE GRADED
Once you have scheduled this meeting and screenshot evidence it has been scheduled, I will give you a score of 5 for completion of the assignment. If you do not attend or need to reschedule, I will change the score to 0 until we are able to successfully meet, at which time it will be changed back to a 5."
Aaron Wilder,"Class Reading 9/30: Buffalo Soldier, Chapter 1",0.0,0,0,2022-09-30 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
When we first looked at Maurice Broaddus' Buffalo Soldier, we stopped before entering page 2. In that first page, we were treated to around 200 words of description and place-making, opening questions like ""what does the word 'sacrament' mean here?"" and ""what are chiba leaves?"", meandering through his mother's stories of duppies (what are duppies?) and Old Higue hanging ""her skin along the branch of a cotton tree before she went about her grim business."" It's not until we get to the last line that we get a reference for all of these details... they relate back to the place that Desmond Coke calls home- Jamaica- and his reminiscing of it from ""under the strange western sky.""
However, all of the intricate details of this page are only the introduction to the way that Broaddus weaves specific details through his work to help bring the reader into the story. In chapter 1, you will see phrases like ""Bulbous, bloodshot eyes, like ebony marbles swimming in a skim of yellow"" and ""mud-sluiced street."" These details are not just occasional, they are constant, and in this reading I want you to take intimate notice of them. Then, I want you to imagine the reading without them. Imagine ""The drunk man watched me"" instead of ""bulbous, blood-shot eyes, like ebony marbles swimming in a skim of yellow, tracked him."" Imagine ""the town was dirty"" instead of ""mud-sluiced street."" 
Because all of these things are examples of showing rather than telling on page 15 of the book. Showing allows us, as readers, to experience these sensations as we would in life with all their power, right alongside those within the pages. In life, there are no flashing signs that say THIS TOWN IS UNSAFE. And yet, we immediately gather how unsafe Desmond and Lij are as they enter the town, even if perhaps they don't quite grasp it yet.  

Rather than telling us that the man who confronts Desmond and Lij is drunk, Maurice Broaddus shows us with his actions and description of him. ""Alcohol wafted on his breath."" The color and look of his eyes. His face ""pocked and rugose."" All of these are characteristics of drunkenness, along with his unprompted aggression with ""You got something to say?"" and blocking their path, clearly looking for a fight. 
Rather than telling us ""this town is a dirty, rough, unsafe place,"" Maurice Broaddus shows us through this interaction with the first man they come across, through the ""mud-sluiced streets,"" the ""accumulated stares"" from people, the ""giant steammen"" at patrol dotting the border.

Your exercise for this reading will be to attempt to recognize the impact of specific detail, specifically moments of showing through description in Chapter 1 of Buffalo Soldier, imagine how what is being shown here would have been different if it were told instead, and, finally, to think about how you can apply this to your own writing that you are drafting right now, in this class.
TASK
The assignment has two primary steps: First, read. Second, respond.
READ: Buffalo Soldier, Chapter 1
RESPOND
Click the ""Next"" button to move to the post-reading quiz. As you're reading, be prepared to answer these three questions:



Quote one passage that demonstrates showing through description in Chapter 1
Imagine how what is being shown through description were told directly instead. What would it say? How would that change the experience for you as a reader?
Find a sentence or two in your writing where you are TELLING when you could be SHOWING. Rewrite the sentence(s) to show, rather than tell. Then think about how this effects the reader's experience.



HOW YOU WILL BE GRADED
A completed assignment will be awarded a score of between 1 and 5. 



5: You have satisfactorily completed the assignment and all of its attributes
2-4: You completed the assignment but missed one or more attributes I was asking for
1: You did something, though it wasn't really what I asked for.

Aaron Wilder,EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: Trip to Cleo's Bodega and Ujamaa Bookstore to get free coffee and pick up Buffalo Soldier,0.0,0,0,2022-09-03 01:01:01.000001,"5 BONUS POINTS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO ATTEND
PURPOSE
You are all, as you know, now members of the Near Northwest Neighborhood, which is really a collection of neighborhoods just northwest of downtown between 38th and 10th, Kessler and Meridian. And one of the purposes of this class is to help you discover, uncover, and more deeply understand communities that you are a part of through acts of inquiry, reading and writing. This is one such opportunity.
Flanner House has been a mainstay and rock within this community for more than 50 years, and is a central hub for much of the work that goes on within it. We'll take a brief tour of Flanner House, your professor will buy you coffee, and you'll get to see Cleo's Bodega (and hear its history), Ujamaa Bookstore (and hear its history) and purchase a copy of Buffalo Soldier, the only required text for this course. If we're lucky (and he is available), the author may even make an appearance at the bookstore to sign your copy!
TASK
Attend a 50 minute adventure on the Flanner House campus taking place BLANK. The class will meet at 11 a.m. at Cleo's Bodega. There are two ways to get there:
1. Via IndyGo Route 15, which will depart from the 30th Street and Cold Spring stop at BLANK. To attend in this manner, you should arrive at the stop no later than BLANK. Your professor will pay your fare both for the ride to Flanner House and your return ride, departing from Flanner House at BLANK.
2. Drive, walk, ride the bus, or otherwise make it to Cleo's Bodega by 11 a.m. and leave around 12 p.m.
3. Take part in a walk around Flanner House campus between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m., including Cleo's Bodega and Coffee Shop, Flanner Farms and Ujamaa Bookstore on the Flanner House grounds. This will include conversation about the histories of these institutions and how they relate or will relate to course content.
4. Record a brief reflection about your experience (will be done on-site)
HOW TO EARN BONUS POINTS
If you attend the day and aren't a jerk, you get 5 bonus points, plus a fantastic new place for you to call part of your neighborhood like a location for quick groceries, a fantastic coffee shop and off-campus study space, and a chill bookstore with lots of events by local artists and writers! 
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SAVVY STUDENTS
You may have noticed that many of the things on the above list are also cross-listed in your ""community gaming"" bonus points section of your syllabus. Yes, if you follow the guidelines for the community gaming bonus points, these bonus points will ""stack"" with those, as well. By my math, you could earn as many as 10-12 bonus points by attending and taking advantage of this tour!"

We have already done an annotated bibliography for this class as a way of textual map-building. And yet, there are many other purposes for doing annotated bibliographies, as we've talked about throughout class, and each one of them can be a means of supporting your writing process. One of the ways that we'll be using them is to literally cut and arrange our resources to help determine how best to utilize them, what narrative is emerging from the resources, and what gaps we have in our narrative that need further research. However, before we get to that point I want you all to understand them just a little bit better. For that reason, our reading today is going to focus on annotated bibliographies.

Aaron Wilder,CLASS READING 9/7,0.0,0,0,2022-09-07 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
We've talked about these ideas about language, power, and their relationships to things you may not have expected like identity and community. Then, we've extended that conversation into how these ideas relate to other identifiers like class groups, and even examined some of the concrete ways that certain populations can feel and be effected by cultural ideas of language and their intersection with our various identities.
Now, we're going to look at an additional dimension of this conversation that involves race and its long and tense history in this country and elsewhere. We've sort of skirted alongside this topic a couple of times with our conversation about Langston Hughes' ""Mother to Son"" and Jamila Lyiscott's ""Three Ways to Speak English."" Now, we're going to confront it head-on. Lisa Delpit does a really solid job of laying out a (very recent) history of the journey Black English has taken even through the courts while analyzing her personal struggle with what WEB DuBois called ""The Double Consciousness,"" the need to appease predominantly white, middle/upper class Discourses while trying to retain identity. Lee Tonouchi, celebrated author and speaker of the language known as ""Hawaiian Pidgin,"" as well, takes a stand on this issue with his commencement speech to graduates of the University of Hawaii. 
The Franciscan Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and especially Reconciliation can play a big role during our class discussion around this topic (following a very brief lecture by myself to provide some additional context as to why this conversation is necessary). How is linguistic justice directly related to racial justice? To economic justice? To justice of space and place (we'll explore this more later!)? And, most of all, what does it look like to live in a world with linguistic justice that lives out these Franciscan Values?

First, read this essay with the critical questions in mind:

Who gets to speak in this piece, and who is silenced? What perspectives am I not seeing?
Which stakeholders' voices are present here, and whose voice is either spoken for (accurately? Inaccurately?) or not heard at all?
Who benefits from this communication? Who loses out from this communication?

Unit 3, as you may have noticed, is entirely dedicated to two things: 

Helping you to revise your idea of ""research"" and figure out a way to incorporate it into how you can make sense of the world
Helping you to revise your idea of ""revision"" and figure out a way to incorporate it into how you can make sense of the world

But there is a third thing that we have sort of touched upon, but I want to make more explicit now. We have been building toward this all semester, and it's time to bring it out in the open. And that is this:

Reminding you what you've known all along- that you and your words have a power. That you and your word matter. That you and your writing can do great things. That that research, revision, and writing can be- and are- both a form of and precursor to actions. Actions YOU are capable of. Actions that utilize both with your previous knowledge and experience and the knowledge and experience you've gained in this class. Actions which can, if you choose to, help bring about a better world filled with Peace and Justice.

This week we will be basing our discussions and work around these principles and answering these questions for you, personally. What is ""research"" to you, and how can it be of use to you and the world you want to build? How can the concepts of ""revision"" we've been talking through this semester help you to achieve those goals? And what powers do you and your voice have to help bring about greater Peace and Justice in the world?

One question I have is... well, did it work?
And, hopefully, that's a question that you are left with, as well. And that's, really where research begins. With a question. And for this assignment, you are going to spend just a little bit of time looking into an answer for that- the ""learning"" portion of research.

For this assignment, you'll need to do a bit of digging into the current state of homelessness in Indianapolis compared to where it was in 2015 at the release of The Advocate.

This is it! We are finishing our course text, Buffalo Soldier. Along the way, we've focused heavily on how the writing emphasizes our theme of home, as well as the things we have been learning about writing along the way- specificity and structure and language choices.
What you might not know is that the author of this text is not only a highly-acclaimed and incredibly in demand Afrofuturist author. But, he's also a friend of mine who lives right here in Indianapolis and teaches middle school. He may or may not be able to speak with us this semester, but every time he does, he emphasizes over and over and over again two things that you must do as a writer: Read critically, and revise. When he talks about his writing process, he talks about how there can be up to seven completely new versions of a novel before he even knows what he's really writing about. And then after that there are dozens more.
If you don't feel great about your first drafts, your second drafts, or even your third drafts, just remember- someone who writes two books, dozens of short stories and dozens more articles, pamphlets, etc. and leads writing workshops for the community in his home as well as chairing international writing conferences isn't usually happy with his, either.

This is it! We are finishing our course text, Buffalo Soldier. Along the way, we've focused heavily on how the writing emphasizes our theme of home, as well as the things we have been learning about writing along the way- specificity and structure and language choices.
What you might not know is that the author of this text is not only a highly-acclaimed and incredibly in demand Afrofuturist author. But, he's also a friend of mine who lives right here in Indianapolis and teaches middle school. He may or may not be able to speak with us this semester, but every time he does, he emphasizes over and over and over again two things that you must do as a writer: Read critically, and revise. When he talks about his writing process, he talks about how there can be up to seven completely new versions of a novel before he even knows what he's really writing about. And then after that there are dozens more.
If you don't feel great about your first drafts, your second drafts, or even your third drafts, just remember- someone who writes two books, dozens of short stories and dozens more articles, pamphlets, etc. and leads writing workshops for the community in his home as well as chairing international writing conferences isn't usually happy with his, either. But with time, he turns out work that looks like what you've read in this class.

One of the best things about a writing class at Marian University is that we prioritize one-on-one interaction with you as writers and as people. In that way, I hope to get to know you as an individual that I can know not only know as a student, but as a person. I hope by some point in this class that we have built a positive relationship that involves trust, understanding and an affinity for exploring the ideas that you love and vibe with through writing. In order to do that, though, I need to meet with you one-on-one rather than in a group of a half-dozen or more. This is the first step in that process.
TASK
You will use this link to schedule this appointment. Make sure to choose my name when you're looking to schedule the time. If the link does not work for you for whatever reason, you should use Microsoft Outlook to schedule a one-on-one meeting with me in my office, Faculty C, in the Mother Theresa Hackelmeier Memorial Library (second floor, right above the writing center). A quick tutorial about how to schedule an online appointment can be found here. Ignore the part about including a TEAMS meeting... we will be meeting in person.
HOW YOU'LL BE GRADED
Once you have scheduled this meeting and screenshot evidence it has been scheduled, I will give you a score of 5 for completion of the assignment. If you do not attend or need to reschedule, I will change the score to 0 until we are able to successfully meet, at which time it will be changed back to a 5."

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers. 
TASK
READ



University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection (Links to an external site.)
Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.



Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Keep your reflection 100 - 250 words

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

WRITE
Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.



Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Keep your reflection 100 - 250 words

This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this unit and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

Research in learning has routinely shown us that learning is much more complicated than simply looking at and digesting information. To learn material so that you are capable of applying that learning in new situations, there are significant hurdles to that acquisition, then detection of moments when the learning is truly applicable, electing to utilize that learning in this moment, and finally reflecting upon that learning to decide not just that you will utilize it, but how  you will adapt it to this new scenario.  One of the models for this that has proven most effective is the following:
Preview



Attend
Review
Study
Assess



This means that before you undertake a learning opportunity such this week of class, you will be looking forward to the learning moment and think about what you might be asked to do/learn and take an honest look at your current understandings of the subject and expectations. You must then attend class, of course. But after class, you should review what took place in class and reflect upon its impact and the ways it fits in with other learning.
This assignment begins this three-part framework for this unit. I can't really structure your study (other than building in writing assignments) or your accessing your learning in other learning scenarios, but I can create a preflection, learning and reflection dynamic. And this assignment is the first step in that dynamic- this preview or preflection stage of the learning process.
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple question below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



Based on the knowledge and experience I have at my disposal now, what do I expect from this week of the course, and from where do I think those expectations emerge?



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper.

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the best possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task- include all of the things I ask from you, and while showcasing each individual piece, also feel like a single, cohesive piece of art. You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work.

As we have emphasized strongly in this class all year, Writing is Revising. Writing is not drafting. Writing is not editing. Scholars have found that professional writers spend around 90% of their time revising.
This can look like a lot of different things, and we have experienced some of them in this class. Feedback from lab instructors, peers in your class or peers in the Writing Center. We have learned about twelve different types of feedback you can ask for. We have learned about revision about helping yourself to ""Re-Envision"" your focus, your organization, or your purpose. We have even created Peer Review Forms and Revision Plans for your documents. And we've talked through other blended revision/drafting techniques like redrafting, venn diagrams, word association, and more. And importantly, we have learned how to utilize Rhetorical Grammar- using ""grammar,"" or the structure by which we form thoughts through writing, in a purposeful manner to communicate in intended ways with an audience, even breaking ""grammatical rules"" in order to fulfill that goal- and multiple Englishes and other languages available to us as resources.
Now is time to put that learning into action to bring your works, which up to this point have been process drafts, into another gear. I know you all have more that you can give. You can rework that My Page 1 into a work of Flash Fiction. You can reconfigure your Home That Built Me into a letter to your mother to let her know how you've grown since the day you first met 18 years ago, and that you'll be okay now that you've left to go off to college. You can reconfigure your ""Re-Mix"" essay to bring that section that you really needed later in the piece to be there and do what it needs to do, and revise sections to more effectively stick to the thematic purpose. And you can reconfigure your research to be, instead of addressed to an academic or ""professional"" audience, addressed directly to the business owners in your community to ask for support in your efforts to build a better community that embodies Peace and Justice. 
TASK
Choose one of your works from Portfolios 1, 2 or 3 that you will be revising for your Final Portfolio, and using this Revision Plan Worksheet, complete a Revision Plan for that assignment. Remember, you will have a little over THREE FULL WEEKS to complete this revision plan, so you should set your goals accordingly. This revision plan should:



Answer each line fully and completely. Short and uninspired answers will not do.
Demonstrate a level of deep thought about each line. ""Everyone benefits and no one loses out"" is not an acceptable answer.
Create a concrete plan of revision. Where will you focus your energy (focus, organization or purpose?), what strategies will you use, and to whom will this piece now speak?



Your revision plan can, if necessary, include an accompanying paragraph with any questions, concerns, or context that you wish to present to your professor.
OBJECTIVES



Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives

Aaron Wilder,DUE 12/13: FINAL PORTFOLIO,200.0,0.19102196752626552,2.865329512893983,2022-12-14 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Like every other portfolio you've turned in in this class, the Final Portfolio is a chance for you to demonstrate the ways that you've applied what we've learned in class to your writing projects. The only difference between this one and your last 3- besides that you've had three times to practice now- is that this portfolio is an opportunity to showcase your work and growth throughout the entire course.
As we've discussed many times in class, the measure of a writer is not how cleanly they can get words down on paper the first try, but the process by which they move from concept to polish. The best writers, in other words, are not those who can vomit most efficiently onto the page, but those who are the most tenacious, stick with it the longest, apply their learning, and come to a final product conscious and confident of its eventual impact on the audience. This portfolio is a chance for you to show that trait in yourself through your writing and its growth.
***
This portfolio's intent is outlined in the course syllabus, and is meant to demonstrate your ability aligning with the following General Education Objectives:
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes;
And Course Outcomes:
a. Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
b. Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
c. Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
d. Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .
***
You have, throughout this unit, been asked to interpret meaning from different information mediums like text, audio, video and image, as well as a range of information presentation types from maps to articles to documentaries. You've been asked to communicate within a range of purposes, from informative research to inquiry to opinion to persuasion, within a wide variety of genres. 
You have been asked to utilize various techniques discussed in class such as showing/telling, naming and structure, as well as a range of evidence strategies from emotional/logical to anecdotal to communal to scholarly. Your audiences have been both academic and non-academic, they have required multiple perspectives and critical inquiry into who benefits/is left out, who gets to speak/is silenced, and what ideologies are present/ignored. And, through your reflective writing and reading strategies we've learned, you've been asked to reflect on how these writings bear upon your ideas of research, language choices, writing, and our ever constant theme of ""home.""
We've been working on this all semester working up to this revision-focused portfolio, and you are now prepared to demonstrate that learning. 
Instructions
In a single document, you will combine the following writing projects

First- An Artist's Statement, designed to prepare your reader for what they will be reading. This should set me up to view the rest of your portfolio through the lens you'd like me to see it. Do you want me to see your growth as a writer? Do you want me to see the way you've really attacked ""naming"" as a strategy? Do you want me to see the contrast between the different types/genres of research writing you've undertaken? Set me up to read it that way not just with your words, but with good writing that utilizes the very strategies we've been talking about all semester from naming to showing vs. telling to meaning-making structure, and even references to the text if that will be helpful. 
Next- In whatever order you deem most appropriate for the way you'd like me to read your Unit 3 Portfolio:

A Unit 1 Section, consisting of: 

Your chosen document from Unit 1 in its original version from Portfolio 1. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 1
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.
A Unit 2 Section, consisting of: 

Your chosen document from Unit 2 in its original version from Portfolio 2. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 2
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.
A Unit 3 Section, consisting of:

Your chosen document from Unit 3 in its original version from Portfolio 3. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 3
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.
A minimum of one additional writing, meant to demonstrate your overall growth through this class, consisting of:

Your chosen document  in its original version from its original portfolio. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 3
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.
A link to the Class Mapping Project, with a brief explanation of how to find your contributions to this project.

 

Last- Your Final Course Reflection. If you need to edit this for submission, you may. It should work as a bookend to your Artist's Statement and build upon the mini-reflections within each section, telling me not what should I expect but what learning did I just witness in these pages? I should leave the final section of your portfolio feeling that I understand not only what growth was demonstrated in your writing, but what growth have you undergone that cannot be seen in texts or you were not able to effectively demonstrate with the texts that you've chosen, and what growth you have undergone as a writer and thinker over the course of this semester. Most importantly, I want to know how you plan to utilize that growth as you move through your collegiate and post-collegiate life, and why that growth is a valuable asset to you now and in the future both as a student and a person living life on this earth.

GRADING CRITERIA
There are 200 total points available for the Final Portfolio. You will be graded based on the rubric attached to this assignment, with primary focus on the Course Objectives/Outcomes and the themes of each unit, as well as the standard process, rhetorical decisions, organization/structure, linguistic choices, how effectively you responded to the prompt, whether your writing demonstrates the Franciscan Values, and whether you've included all of the appropriate pieces required for the portfolio listed above.
HOW TO SUBMIT
There are multiple ways to construct your portfolio, but it should be submitted either as a link to a webpage like Wix or a Word Online doc, or as a file such as a Power Point or Word document. Ensure that you are taking into account how your portfolio will appear visually in whatever format you choose. As we talked about in our unit on Structure, the way your writing presents visually is part of the rhetorical choices you make and one of the ways you create meaning and readability!
One final bit of advice: While you definitely want to let me know which piece in your portfolio is which, creating TITLES are a huge help toward building a full piece of writing! Titles are the first thing a reader sees when they open up your document, and ""Unit 3 Portfolio"" is not nearly as compelling or as effective at providing a reader an effective starting point as ""It's Alive: Research in the Real World through a College Freshman's Eyes"" and ""Homelessness Research Project"" is not as emotionally thwacking as ""When Your City Doesn't Want You"" or ""Solidarity Beneath Davidson Street."""

Research in learning has routinely shown us that learning is much more complicated than simply looking at and digesting information. To learn material so that you are capable of applying that learning in new situations, there are significant hurdles to that acquisition, then detection moments when the learning is truly applicable, electing to utilize that learning in this moment, and then reflecting upon that learning to decide not just that you will utilize it, but how  you will adapt it to this new scenario.  One of the models for this that has proven most effective is the following:



Preview
Attend
Review
Study
Assess



This means that before you undertake a learning opportunity such as class, you need to look forward to the learning moment and think about what you might be asked to do/learn and take an honest look at your current understandings of the subject and expectations of the day. You must then attend class, of course. But after class, you should review what took place in class and reflect upon its impact and the ways it fits in with other learning.
This assignment begins this three-part framework. I can't really structure your study (other than building in writing assignments) or your accessing your learning in other learning scenarios, but I can create a preflection, learning and reflection dynamic. And this assignment is the first step in that dynamic- this preview or preflection stage of the learning process.
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple question below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



Based on the knowledge and experience I have at my disposal now, what do I expect from this course, and from where do you think those expectations emerge?



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I will highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

As we are building up our ability to tell our story of our home(s), there are some genres that are highly illustrative of the tools available to us. Poetry is one of those genres, because quite often, poetry eschews the narrative and expository elements of writing that are often fore-fronted in other genres. So while we are entering this place, we're going to take a look at a good bit of poetry that does exactly this. Some of these poems will even be examples of the ""I Am From"" poem that we will be writing in class to provide you with a template for the work you'll be doing yourself.

Aaron Wilder,CLASS READINGS 8/26,0.0,0,0,2022-08-26 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As we've been talking about the spaces around us, we've been slowly working toward making the connection back to how these things relate to our language and relationships to learning and writing. Now, these two things are going to slam squarely into each other for this reading.
You may have heard in the past people talk about what it means to speak ""Correctly."" Well, I'm here to tell you that, unfortunately, they're usually flat out wrong. In fact, they probably don't speak what they view as ""correctly"" themselves! Even teachers, it turns out, who harp on ""correctness"" are often simply responding to various pet peeves that they have rather than anything supported by actual linguistic research. Their perceptions about what is ""correct"" aren't informed by this research. So... what are they informed by?
Clearly, communication is not just about the linguistic patterns used. There are lots and lots of things that language is about, though. And that's what this piece will delve into. But more importantly, it will reframe what you may have set in mind that are ""Bad Ideas About Writing"" into good ideas about writing.
When you read this piece, reflect upon yourself. In what spaces do you feel most comfortable, and how do you think that the relationship between your primary or ""home"" Discourse(s) and the Discourse of other spaces where you feel less comfortable might impact those feelings and your ability to effectively navigate within those spaces?

When you think of ""home,"" what do you think of? I'm sure that, for many of us, it is a physical structure and we are pretty dang sure that that's the thing that home means. We even have terms for people who don't have that- homeless. But one theme that you are going to notice in this course is that when things seem obvious, that is exactly the moment that we need to engage our critical questions to further examine that topic, because not many things are as simple as they seem.
One place we will routinely visit to illuminate difficult or seemingly simple topics that are likely much more complex are histories. Histories can provide us glimpses into the world before this concept, and what conditions were brought together to bring this concept into the world. And this is what we will be doing with this first reading. How did the concept of ""home"" come to be? And, more importantly, what don't we already know about this concept that might shift our understanding of it?

Aaron Wilder,Exploratory Draft: The Home That Built Me,5.0,0.004775549188156638,0.07163323782234958,2022-09-01 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Exploratory Drafts will become something you'll do for every large assignment in this course. Their purpose is not to create something perfect or even something acceptable, but rather to simply create something. This is a moment for you to, as Ms. Frizzle says, ""make mistakes, take chances, and get messy!"" Try things out. Feel out your thoughts. See what's going on in there, and... explore. You will absolutely not be graded upon your ability to write something ""perfect"" on your first try. You will, however, be graded on whether you tried.
""The Home That Built Me"" is an exploration into the ways that linguistic identity, writer identity, and environment interplay. You'll use the content that you've created so far through your My Page 1 and I Am From writings as a starting point for this essay, and build from there using the attributes of Discourses we can glean from our readings. This will be an exploration of the ways your language has helped build, and is built by, all those things we've talked about as ""home"" and the other stuff that's connected to our language and identity. This may be perhaps your first opportunity to look deeply at the ways that your environment and the ways you identify through language relate. As we've said before, these things are the water in which we swim, and are therefore often completely unexamined in our lives- and when we do take the time to really examine it with clear eyes and a bit of basic language knowledge, we can find hidden connections that we didn't really expect. It's your job to work toward making those connections in this assignment.
TASK
Create a draft of an essay that begins the process of exploring the relationship between the spaces you consider ""home"" and your linguistic identity. It should adhere to the following criteria to be considered a success:



Your draft should demonstrate the beginnings of a piece that will end at a minimum of 4 pages
Your draft should begin from elements covered in previous writing throughout this unit and build from it
Your draft should begin to draw on some of the concepts we've covered in our readings and class discussions such as multiple Englishes, the connection between language and history, the connections between language and other ways that we express/internalize identity, and more.
Your draft should incorporate examples of your ""Home Discourse,"" or the ways that you speak in your ""home community."" This could be in your physical home with your parents or siblings, aunts uncles or cousins. It could be at the race track where you and your friends share racing-specific language. It could be back in your country of origin.
Your draft should incorporate some explanation of what makes your ""Home Discourse"" unique
Your draft should incorporate some explanation of how this language, of which you've given an example, is connected to your personal identity, your community identity, and how that personal and community identity is expressed in other ways besides your speech but connected to it like body movements, dress, the things your community values most, etc.
Your draft should begin to incorporate at least some of our class readings directly
Your draft should include at least one image (you can pull this directly from your Visual Identity Projects)
Your draft should utilize appropriate Englishes or other languages to speak to an intended audience



You can find the final requirements for The Home That Built Me, which you will turn in with your Unit 1 Portfolio, here.

This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this week and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
In a minimum of 100 words and maximum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past, in this class, high school, or before? Why or why not? 
Do these assignments remind me of anything that I've ever had to do outside of classes? Why or why not?
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class? Remember that we have course objectives and outcomes to guide you in answering this question!
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? Go beyond ""I'm going to do the work."" What concepts or skills we've covered so far in class (last week we covered specificity- especially in relation to the concept of multiple Englishes and their connections to place/history, and the concept of rhetorical grammar).



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

Aaron Wilder,CLASS READINGS 9/9,0.0,0,0,2022-09-09 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
In class today, we will be taking our opportunity to meet in class to discuss our exploratory drafts of ""The Home That Built Me."" To do so, we need a bit of context. Many of you may not have ever reviewed your peers' work before, and that's perfectly fine. We're going to learn a good bit about how, exactly, to go about doing that before we jump in. The first thing to learn, of course, is how exactly one CAN respond to your peers' writing.
Peter Elbow- a towering figure in the field of writing studies- and Pat Belanoff, another very well-known scholar in the field (especially in responding to writers) have summarized some of their academic works in an attempt to provide you with a digestible framework for responding to your peers' writing. In particular when we're dealing with the subject of writing where identity is so interwoven into our subject matter, we need to be sure that we're responding in ways that will be both beneficial and sensitive to our counterpart. That's why at the start of your peer response, you should introduce yourself, and then ask at least these three questions before reading:

What is something you feel is most special about your linguistic identity and the place/space/community that it emerges from?
Invite them to tell you a little bit more
What type of response do you feel would be most helpful for you, so that I can read your writing looking for that type of feedback opportunity?

In addition, we'll do another quick reading from ""Bad Ideas About Writing"" that will combat another myth about writing- ""Strong Writing and Writers Don't Need Revision."" In fact, scholarship in Writing Studies shows that quite the opposite is true! The strongest writers go through the MOST ROBUST revision processes! In fact, while students tend to go through between one and three drafts of their pieces, professional writers (depending on their field/genre) go through, on average, well over 20 drafts! But, as you'll read, these changes in professional writers aren't just ""changes for the sake of change,"" but instead, in the metaphor ""Giovanelli uses regarding professional academic writer Tim Weninger's revision process, ""[aiming] for the jugular in... writing. [Going] after wholesale overhaul of [your] argument and of [your] larger work"" (105). That's why we've slowly built our writing up, piece by piece, into a full draft, and now will be going through at least two (guided) revision processes to take this completed draft into its final form that you'll present in your portfolio. Best of luck on your peer reviews!

Aaron Wilder,CLASS READINGS 8/31,0.0,0,0,2022-08-31 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Later last week we brushed up against the concept of Multiple Englishes. In class, we read Langston Hughes' ""Mother to Son,"" and agreed- languages are only as ""correct"" as they are ""effective,"" and in this case, the language we've been probably told all our lives is the ""correct"" English would absolutely not have been as effective as the one Langston Hughes chose to write in.
Today, we're going to continue to explore that concept through a couple of excerpts of articles that are a touch more ""academic"" focused, and another reading from ""Bad Ideas About Writing"" that will work to then connect these student and teacher perspectives and answer the question that both of the previous articles are asking... ""why the heck do we need to learn 'this,'"" whatever the ""this"" happens to be. In this case, about the ways language, culture, and the ways we feel belonging or not in certain spaces (like classrooms) can effect how we feel about those spaces and our successes or challenges in them.
There are probably going to be a few things in these readings that are a bit challenging. Some things may seem unclear. That's perfectly fine. That discomfort? That's how you grow! That feeling of not knowing or not understanding? That's the feeling of an opportunity for learning! Before that discomfort, you didn't know that you didn't know. Knowing the things that you need to find clarity on is the first step toward having that clarity, and then, later, being able to apply the things that you've learned to your writing in this class and beyond.
The biggest thing I want you to focus on here, the thing that will help you GREATLY in growing your ""I Am From"" to your ""My Page 1,"" and now to your large assignment for the unit, the ""Home That Built Me,"" is seeing the connections between cultural markers like clothing, hair, posture, actions, or as one of our excerpts says, our ""ways of speaking, listening, reading, and/or writing integrated with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing-"" and the ways that you have lived in your language(s) for your whole life. The focus of ""The Home That Built Me"" is on your language and identity, and for that we need to talk about its connection to all of those other things that make up all the other things that connect to it and make your linguistic identity yours, or our understanding of your language is incomplete.
Sometimes, the ways we exist in our language and identity will come into conflict with the ways others' does. And when that happens, there can be periods of discomfort, misunderstanding, or even judgement or punishment from the person who has the ability to do so. For instance, when I was new to teaching writing courses at the university, there were all of these things that I didn't understand... Objectives, Outcomes, Pedagogies, Methodologies, Critical Perspectives, Assessments, etc. I was like... but I just want to teach? I has been trained in writing and language, but all of these people seemed to understand this entirely different world I was expected to just know without anyone teaching me. I felt silly, stupid, and underprepared. I felt like I didn't want to ask what these things meant because if I didn't understand them, I wasn't a good instructor. But what I realized after doing a bit of reading is that these were things I was already thinking about... what are students going to do in class? (Objectives). What do you want students to learn from these activities? (Outcomes). How are you going to approach it? (Pedagogy). How are you going to have them approach research? (Methodology). What places do you want them to think deeply about the ways their writing interacts with the world? (Critical Perspectives). How will you know you're successful? (Assessments). What I didn't realize until I was immersed in the Discourse of Education is that for people who care and want to do well teaching, they're already things to think about- but having those new terms and being able to delve into those topics, know their boundaries, know their histories, know their receptions and perceptions, etc. allowed me to better hone all of those things I was already thinking about, learn from others and become a better instructor.
We all experience this thing, called ""Discourse Tension."" It often happens when we're coming into a place that's new for us, trying to get into a new activity or group, or moving to a new community... but not always. At it's core, it's about confronting difference between ourselves and others that we maybe didn't know were differences we had or maybe even didn't know were possibilities for the ways other people exist and expect others to exist. I didn't know there could be expectations on course outcomes, because I'd never had to think of them before, but now that I'd confronted this difference in world view and expectations of behavior in this new reality, how should I react? How can I resolve this Discourse tension? Where have you experienced Discourse Tension before? Was it when you entered college and are now hearing all kinds of new things, burdened with new expecations, trying to break into new social circles, understand the language of your professors (like ""Discourse Tensions,"" perhaps!) and how you're supposed to respond to their prompts?
For another example of Discourse Tension rooted not in entering a new community (academia) but between racial/ethnic/linguistic groups, I've included a TED Talk by the glorious Dr. Jamyla Lyiscott. In it, she talks about the tensions between her ""three ways to speak English"" that she navigates day in and day out as a Black woman in academia. Pay attention to when she notes moments of tension, and within/between which communities those tensions arise and why. How does her English change to meet the needs (or requirements) of different communities? Why does she have to change, and do others as well? Or is it just her? Or just a particular group or groups of people while some others are not required to change? Why or why not, do you think?

We've spent a little bit of time speaking about how Discourse Tension can impact educational relationships and opportunities, and have a fairly minimal example of that happening, but without a whole lot of details. But how, exactly, can that Discourse Tension actually impact the realities of people in the world, and what, exactly, can we do about it? What types of people are effected by this Discourse Tension, and how can it be resolved? These are questions that a PhD in Education with a focus on linguistics and literacy in young children can address, and does in the article we'll be reading today. When reading, I want you to imagine yourself in the shoes of the people that Dr. Purcell-Gates refers to- and not just the two people who are constructed as being ""in the right,"" per se. I want you to also see yourself in the villains of these stories, and think back... have I ever been the villain in these stories? Why are they cast as the villains? What behaviors does Dr. Purcell-Gates use to portray them as such? And what alternative behaviors exist? What social pressures led them to act villainous, and how do those social pressures act in other ways? Have they acted on me?
As a Marian University student, which of the Franciscan Values applies to this situation, and how can we work to embody those values it in our Discourse Relationships?
Discussion and understanding of some of the key arguments in this work will be crucial to being able to effectively participate in next week's reading and discussion, so make sure you've got this down because next week will build off of this!

Aaron Wilder,WRITING: Draft 2: The Home That Built Me,10.0,0.009551098376313277,0.14326647564469916,2022-09-17 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Note: Writing for this piece should be in the language that you speak with your friends and family from these ""home"" locations.
Writing, as we've mentioned many times before, is a process, and one that will come alongside and even lead to learning new things. Your Exploratory draft of your ""The Home That Built Me"" essay emerged from your ""I Am From"" and ""My Page 1"" to create a highly specific focus around your linguistic identity and its  relationship to the other ways you relate to the world. You focused around providing examples of, describing and analyzing your own speech and how it relates to your identity and community. You began to draw from our class readings that speak to how the multiple Englishes, the co-equal versions of English spoken throughout the world, can and do relate to things that perhaps you may never have thought of before like social power, histories, places, race, ethnicity, class, and more, and their unequal impacts on the speakers of those Englishes despite linguists' constant refrain that they are, in fact, equal.
Now, you're going to build on that exploratory draft, incorporating new knowledge from our class readings and discussions, to continue building toward a piece you are proud to have built.
Below, find the requirements for the Final version of ""The Home That Built Me"" which will be due at the end of Week 5. Your Draft 2 is meant to be an attempt at this final version, which I and your classmates will provide feedback on to help you develop Draft 2 in to the final version which will appear in your Unit 1 Portfolio.
Make sure to read this prompt closely and completely. Think about how the design of the Exploratory Draft moved you closer and closer to a version of this assignment that fulfills these requirements. And think about, as you're drafting, how these requirements are guiding you toward thinking critically about your own language, identity, and its place within the world. 
TASK
Your Final Draft (and, of course, Draft 2 as it works toward this final) should: 
PROCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR DRAFT 2 ONLY

Demonstrate significant revision from your Exploratory Draft based on the feedback received from your instructor, peers, Lab Instructor and Writing Center visit(s). Drafts showing only minor revisions will not receive credit. 
Demonstrate increased awareness of the social dimensions of language (relationship to power, ethnicity, race, class, community etc.) beyond the Exploratory Draft due to additional readings and class discussions on the subject since the Exploratory Draft. Essentially, that you've been continuing to learn and have incorporated that learning into your writing.
Demonstrate greater focus on appealing to an ideal reader or audience to whom you wish to speak and accomplish your purpose

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR DRAFT 2 AND FINAL
Focus on Language

Your HTBM should be written, at least partially, in an English you would consider your Home Language.
Your HTBM should focus predominantly on your own language, language practices, and linguistic identity- turning over, thinking about, and analyzing those things you may never have thought of before in light of what we've learned in class so far, but always coming back to these factors as your focus.
Your Linguistic Identity that you choose to focus on should be explicitly named and described.
Your description of your Linguistic Identity should include examples of your Home Language (in quotations) and descriptions of what makes it unique.
Your HTBM should be explicit about what you find valuable about your Home Language
Your HTBM should be explicit about whether these things you value about your home language appear, in your mind, to be shared by our wider culture and academia
In describing your linguistic identity etc., what makes it unique and valuable to you, and whether it is seen in the same light by others in the wider culture/academia, you should support your ideas with a minimum of one class resource cited in MLA format
 

Connections Between Language and Sociocultural Factors


Your HTBM should spend time on what factors we've talked about that relate to language (relationship to power, ethnicity, race, class, community etc.) are most salient in your Home Language and Linguistic Identity.
Your Home Language should be connected to other factors that influence what someone might notice is unique about your linguistic community such as how people talk with their bodies, how people wear their clothes, what values are shared among people in the community, where you come from- in other words, the ""distinctive ways of using discourse, that is, speaking/listening and/or reading/writing coupled with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing"" (Gee, 2011).
Tell your reader about a time your Home Language ever brought you into conflict with someone else, or been a factor in a misunderstanding? Describe what occurred and how some of the factors we've talked about in class relating to Discourse (the ""distinctive ways of using discourse, that is, speaking/listening and/or reading/writing coupled with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing"" (Gee, 2011)) were part of the reason this conflict or misunderstanding occurred.
Do you feel as if you have to ""code switch"" in order to not be perceived negatively in certain places? Where do you do this, and why? If you don't have to do this, as I don't really have to, why is that the case?
What does living the Franciscan Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and Reconciliation look like for our society regarding language and linguistic identity look like to you?
Your concept of Linguistic Identity, Home Language and its relationship to these sociocultural factors we've discussed in class should be supported by a minimum of one class resource cited in MLA format

Connections to Your Identity As a Writer

Your HTBM should think about how your linguistic identity and all these other factors relate to how you have experienced language in school, in other communities, etc. using concrete examples you describe using the types of specificity we've discussed in this unit- both word-level and historically-rooted.
Your HTBM should connect these experiences to whether or not you identify as a writer
Your HTBM should imagine an alternate world where you think differently about writing. What factors (such as the sociocultural factors we've talked about in class) could have changed the ways you think about writing? If your Home Language were supported in the classroom? If you'd thought of writing as fulfilling some real purpose, rather than a 5-paragraph essay for a standardized test assessment? What factors we've talked about in this class might have led to this change?
Has your concept of your writerly identity changed during this class?
In connecting to your identity as a writer, you should back up these ideas with a minimum of one class resource cited in MLA format. 

Formatting and Style Requirements

Your HTBM should be written, at least partially, in the English or other language that you consider your Home Language
Your HTBM should include a minimum of four class resources cited in MLA
All important locations, with a minimum of 2, should be hyperlinked to their Google Earth coordinates
Your HTBM must include at least one image to support the text
Your HTBM must include at least one hyperlinked video or other alternative media form to support the text
All citations in your HTBM should have an in-text component and a corresponding citation in your Works Cited in MLA format on a new page at the end of your document. Cited in this Works Cited, plphabetical order, formatted in a hanging indent, should be:

Each of your minimum of four class resources
Each of your hyperlinked important locations, a minimum of 2
Each image included within your HTBM, a minimum of 1
Each of your hyperlinked videos or alternative media, a minimum of 1


Your HTBM must be at least 4 pages, double-spaced, Times New Roman 12 pt. font- not including your Works Cited page

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

WRITE
Your reflective writing is an opportunity to look back at what we did in class during this week, remind yourself of what happened, and then think more deeply about what we did, how it's meant to help you develop greater agency over your writing, and why these things might be important for you not just to pass your ENG 101/L01, not just to help you write in your other classes, but as a person hoping to make a difference in the world and leave it a better place through the guidance of the Franciscan Sponsorship Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and Reconciliation.
I should see you actively thinking and considering these things on the page. This is our third reflection, so you've now had a bit of practice and gotten some feedback. Your reflection this week should attempt to look more deeply into your learning this week than you have had an opportunity to while it was happening:
Questions you MUST respond to in this reflection:

Go back to your Preflection. Tell me, what were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection?
How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations?
What did we do this week that most impacted you? Take a look back at the Canvas for the week to help guide you in answering this question. Remember, this week focused on not finishing up but concluding our readings/targeted discussions about language and its relation to various social realities and how different racial, ethnic, cultural and community groups relate to it, and then moving into how we can support our peers as writers given these new things we've learned.
Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer? Be specific.
How does this relate to our course objectives (available in the syllabus and just below this text)?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 

Additional questions to consider this week:

How did our readings work together to paint a picture of revision as a tool for your writing?
Do you understand revision differently than you did before this week? If so, how?
How does this idea of revision fit in with our previous readings?
How do these ideas of revision change other concepts you've had in the past about writing?

Your reflection must:

Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Be 100 - 250 words

Every text, whether it is delivered in an image, a chart, a memo, an article or a meme includes author(s) who are making intentional (though perhaps not conscious) choices about what to include. And while these choices, at times, may seem random or arbitrary, they are not. The fields that we have ventured into in this class- those of sociolinguistics, rhetorics, and writing studies, all are very aware that these choices are the result of the choices that have been made in the past, linked to events stretching back and back and back- especially those events that feel ""normal"" or ""natural."" Their normal-ness and natural-ness is born of recurrence, until those choices seem to be the only ones a writer can make. 
But as a class of individuals looking at these choices in an informed and conscious manner, we know different. There are always other choices that can be made, and there are always people already making those choices. Often, those choices are not the ones we (if we're in the group that sees ""normalness"" in what is often called the ""dominant"" perspective) can see without actively seeking them out.
In these readings, we're going to take a look at one of the formats that is often seen as the most normal and natural- a map. How, do you ask, could a map hide anything? It's literally their job to show us things! Or... is it? As we are looking at these maps and looking at the hidden, silenced or alternative perspectives available to us through the use of Critical Questions like ""who gets to speak/is left out?"" ""which perspectives are offered/silenced?"" and ""Who benefits?"" we will often see beneath the surface level and find out that what communications intend and what they do can be radically different. So what, exactly, do the maps you'll see below really do?

When we think of maps and places, we often think about these things as neutral and ahistorical. They are what they are, and that's what they are. When we go to the Yats on Indiana Avenue, there is no history dripping from the walls. We don't see the ghosts of the past immediately on the surface. Things seem as if they have always been and always will be.
But if we think about this for more than just a moment, we know that this is not true. History DOES drip from the walls- just invisibly in the ways that we reckon with the present. Yats would not be there if it weren't for IUPUI. And IUPUI would not be there without a very particular word, ""blight."" And that word would not have existed without segregation, and Indiana's role as a hub of the Klan in the 1910's, 20's and even 30's. And segregation would not have existed without the Union victory in the civil war (and the KKK's victories in the subsequent terrorist-ruled south) that led to a great migration of Black men and women from the South into Indianapolis. And there never would've even been an Indianapolis if it hadn't been for settlers breaking the Royal Proclamation of 1763.
Just as important, not all histories are created equal in that not all histories are readily told. Some histories are readily available to us, like the Crispus Attucks wins in Indiana State Basketball memorialized downtown at the IHSAA Hall of Fame. Far less told is what happened afterward- when the team's victory parade- a parade that had happened every year for the winner of the championship for decades- was rerouted away from downtown due to the perception that Black fans would be violent. This happened again in 1956 after winning their second straight title- after which basketball star Oscar Robertson simply went home rather than face what he deemed a humiliating ""second-class celebration."" Fun fact- you may also know a little bit about the team that won the year before in 1954- the Milan High School Indians, the team memorialized in the movie Hoosiers and the team Hollywood made the intentional choice to immortalize on the silver screen despite essentially making up the whole thing beside the fact that they won a state title. 
For this reading, we're going to investigate the ways that histories continue to live today in the stories that we tell about places and spaces, and the very real lived experiences of people who inhabit those spaces. I want you to look for ways that our ideas of Discourse Tensions could overlap the maps and articles that we will be reading, and think through what Peace and Justice might mean given what we are learning.

While we have been looking at maps, we've been talking about some of the rhetorical choices that go into map design and how those decisions effect the not intended, but real function of those maps and how they can actively effect the lives of others. This, of course, is not only true of maps. Not all writing effects lives in the same ways, and poetry probably doesn't have the same tangible consequences upon our lives as mapping, but one of the key facts about writing is that it does effect you in some way. That is, after all, its purpose- to communicate in ways that impact readers.
One of those rhetorical decisions we've been focusing on is the structure of those pieces. How are the elements organized so as to communicate with and effect the reader? In the following pieces, I want you to focus on that structure. What does the structure communicate between these pieces? How are they different, and what effect does that have upon the way it effects you? Most important, how can you make intentional rhetorical decisions about structure in order to facilitate a certain effect?
Things to look at:

What does this writing ""look like"" on the page?

How long is it?
Is it right justified? Left justified? Center? A combination?
How does it use paragraph breaks? Long paragraphs? Short? A combination?
Why do you think the paragraph breaks exist where they are? What effect does that have on the feeling of the writing?
How does the writing use ""sentence"" structure? Long sentences? Short? A combination?
Are the sentences flowing and lyrical? Choppy and abrupt? A combination?
Does the writing deviate from the ""rules"" of sentence structure at all? If so, what effect does that have on how the writing feels to you?
How does the writing use words? Is there a rhyme structure? Alliteration? Long words? Short? A combination?
What type of sounds to the words create coming from your mouth? Are there an overabundance of certain types of sounds throughout or in certain places- hard consonants like T and P and K, or soft like N and M and S? Short, ""tight"" vowels like ""ih"" and ""eh"" or long, rounded vowels like ""oh"" and ""ooh"" and ""uh""
Does the writing code switch at all, and if so, when and how?

Aaron Wilder,Week 7 Overview: The Structures That Build Us,0.0,0,0,2022-10-03 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Last week, we spent time looking at writing structures and the ways they can actually serve to craft ideas of physical space and, therefore, even our physical space itself. This week, we'll be taking that lesson forward into our writing in a bit more subtle ways. For instance, how can we utilize a typically-boring structural element- the works cited- to help enrich the textual/hypertextual world of our writing? What purposes can this type of structure serve, and which purposes do I want it to serve? And how can structure in writing serve as a meaning-making tool, to help craft my understandings of a piece of writing?
We'll seek out the ways that structure can almost literally transport your reader from one place to another, and even think about the ways that changing the organization of your work- one of the elements of structure- can change the possible meaning that can be gleaned from it. Then, we'll get to work creating a piece that is most likely a radical structural departure from any work that you've ever done before- our ""Re-Mix Essay.""

Let me tell you a secret. I hate formatting. I hate it. I run a writing center on campus, and hate it. And yet, it's something that I don't save to the end of a project like a lot of things that I hate to do like painting my shed (still need to do that) or trimming when I mow. I do it right at the beginning, because I've recognized something about formatting. When done in a particular way with an eye toward its utility, it can be incredibly useful.
First off, formatting hasn't, historically, been meant for writers. Instead, it's been meant for readers. An in-text citation, footnote or works cited are what are called hypertextual elements-- ways that you can guide your readers beyond your text to supplement your own argumentation and provide substantiation through the work of others. In our use of these formatting styles, it can also transport readers spatially to places we want them to see and experience through media beyond the orthographic text. You see, formatting, used purposefully and with an eye on the message you are crafting and how your audiences are likely to navigate your work can create a far richer, more captivating and potentially more persuasive experience for your reader, bolstering the effectiveness of your writing without having to write a single additional word.
Second, an annotated bibliography can be a great window into asking yourself who you are allowing time to speak in your writing. If, for instance, you were writing a history of the American Revolution and, looking through your notes, you see British political voices, American political voices, and French political voices, you could ask yourself ""who else had a role and stake in the American Revolution who I haven't included?"" The answers might include the hundreds of thousands of people living on the continent who did not belong to those groups, but definitely had a role in the conflict such as the various Algonquin nations (Iroquois being a prominent member), Black people who were enslaved on the continent or Black freedmen, women who were shut out of the political process, poorer white men who did not have the platform of a political position, other groups who today we consider ""white"" who at the time would not have been considered as such, etc. And perhaps you may have never even noticed these omissions if you hadn't seen all of your citations in one place.
Third, there are lots of programs that can help you with formatting- if you commit to them from the get-go. We're in the age of automation, and formatting hasn't been exempted from that. There are lots of really, really bad ones (PLEASE don't use easybib or online software like that. It gets things wrong more than right), but there are some really, really good ones as well like Mendeley, EndNote and Academic Writer (for APA, the program in which I wrote my thesis). And these programs not only tackle formatting for you, but they can automatically create and format in-text and bibliographic citations, help you to chain research, offer similar articles via in-program suggestion or even on a regular basis via email if you have a research area you are really interested in, and guide you through the process of crafting a paper in a certain formatting style in ways that become worry-free.
It's with these two things in mind- the ways that we can use formatting to craft a more valuable reader experience and the ways that beginning in an effective environment can craft a more valuable writer experience- that we enter this next phase of our writing journey in this class. I don't want you to think of formatting, like I did as a college freshman, as that tedious thing that I have to do so my teachers don't steal points from me. I want you to think about it as a dynamic method of engaging in an inquiry process that will lead to a richer experience for your reader.

So far, we have looked at structure and the ways it acts relatively directly to influence readers. However, structure doesn't have to be such a bang-you-on-the-head phenomenon. Structure can work in much more subtle ways, as well. And while we've practiced those subtle-yet-harsh methods of structure in our Class Map, we'll be exploring other ways that structure impacts the effect your writing can have through these next few pieces.
We've had a discussion about these readings before, but I want us to revisit in light of our last full week of discussions over structure. What new things do you see in these poems after learning about structure for the previous week? How do these new things that you're seeing impact your reading of the poetry? How can they impact the ways that you can go about structuring your writing?
 
As you are reading, ask yourself what elements of structure are you seeing from the list below:



Macro-structure (alignments, fonts, page colors- ""whole-page"" or ""whole-document"" structural elements)
Paragraph-level structure (line breaks, ""white space,"" the ways sentences fit together)
Sentence structure (long or short, run-ons or fragments, grammatical choice, use of larger/smaller words, alliteration, etc.)
Micro-structure (below sentence level such as spelling choices, grammar choices, punctuation choices etc.)

Who benefits from this communication? Who loses out from this communication?
Second, write a brief reflection responding to the following focus questions, seen above:

How does the ""Macro-structure"" (alignments, fonts, page colors- ""whole-page"" or ""whole-document"" structural elements) of these pieces differ, and what impact does that have on the feeling of the writing?
How does the Paragraph-level structure (line breaks, ""white space,"" the ways sentences fit together) impact your reading of these pieces?
How does the Sentence structure (long or short, run-ons or fragments, grammatical choice, use of larger/smaller words, alliteration, etc.) impact your reading of these pieces?

As we are looking toward our second drafts of our ""Ode to an Intersection"" and ""Strange Angels"" poems, and then looking forward to radically re-using them and our other writings in our ""Re-Mix Essay,"" I invite you to read the following on the potential purposes of revision, and the ways to think of revision not as a way of ""paring down"" as one author puts it here, but as a way of re-envisioning our writing.
Particularly useful, here, are the concrete ways the author provides to think about re-envisioning: 



Re-envisioning your writing's focus
Re-envisioning your writing's organization (one of the elements of structure we've been talking about)
Re-envisioning your writing's audience (he pairs this one with another element I've separated out below)
Re-envisioning your writing's purpose



Since you are going to be doing a lot of re-envisioning at the end of this week, make sure to utilize this breakdown as you think about ways that you can re-envision your writing to more effectively do what you're hoping it will do!

Annotated Bibliographies can serve many purposes. They can be a guide for ongoing research. They can be a roadmap, acting as something of a journal of readings and your understandings of them and how they fit into a larger discussion that you can look back on as you move through a learning/writing process. They can serve as an indicator to your instructor as to where your thoughts are on a subject. They can even be a took for you to see what perspectives you have or have not included in your writing. And, as they are often used in college courses, they can serve to provide an indication as to your understanding of materials/formatting styles. 
However, in this course it will be doing something else beyond that. Our annotated bibliography will actually be an integral part of your reader experience, taking them on a hypertextual journey from one space to another, utilizing a form of writing technology to show your reader information they could not encounter with just orthography and then augmenting that with a paragraph briefly summarizing that resource, and then about the ways this experience relates to the ways you might utilize it in writing. In this annotated bibliography, your reader may find themselves moving from your favorite park in your home town to a scholarly reading on the power of language to create in-groups to an infographic about demographics in your home town to a meme about language use in your community- all of which will help to build a fuller understanding of the reality you'd like to construct for your audience and the stories you'd like to tell them.
Our annotated bibliography will follow us through this course from this point on, so make sure you save a copy to turn in here, as well as a copy to continue adding onto. I want you to think about the ways that these various sources can develop your stories and demonstrate that, rather than thinking of this as a single assignment.
I highly encourage the use of mla.org's style guide for this assignment, as well as software designed to assist in these types of projects such as Mendeley or Endnote. Do not use easybib or another online citation generator. There are levels to these types of programs- their algorithms can be more or less accurate, and most of the common ones are quite literally wrong more than they're right.
TASK
Your annotated bib should:



Contain at least three google earth citations for locations you have referenced in your writing
Contain citations for each of your photos shared in your Visual Identity Project
Contain at least three references in MLA format to scholarly works we have discussed in class
Contain a 1-2 paragraph annotation immediately following each citation that

Summarizes the primary information contained in the source
Evaluates the relevancy and features of the source to our work in this course
Provides a brief interpretation of how you will incorporate the information within your work

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

Aaron Wilder,Practice Draft: Re-Mix Essay,5.0,0.004775549188156638,0.07163323782234958,2022-10-11 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As we have been discussing structure the last couple of weeks, we've talked about physical structure of the world and how it can be ""mapped"" by different rhetorical choices. We've talked about the ways that structure can communicate meaning within our writing, and different manners of using structure to develop our writing. Now, we're going to take the next step, and create a structure of writing you've probably never used before, and we're going to focus not just partly, but ENTIRELY on structure to do it.
A Braided Essay is often a term used to describe the type of essay that we're going to be writing. It is a type of writing that takes at least three different narratives, often told in different genres, and weaves them together- alternately telling one, then the other, then the other. And when these narratives are told together, they make up a brand new narrative. Some of my favorite writing that I've done in the past is similar to the braided essay (though I have often kept it to weaving two stories narratives together rather than three), and some favorite cinematic fiction takes on this form, such as Love Actually or even Avengers use braided or parallel narratives. In fact, the entire MCU could be seen as one big braided essay, weaving together multiple stories to build a larger narrative arc. One of the most important factors- if not the most important factor- in these essays is how they are structured and not how each of these narratives are told, but when and in which chunks and ordering.
TASK
You are going to compose a ""Re-Mix"" of your work this semester so far, meaning you're going to take the work that you've already done, chop it up and put it back together again to form something new like a DJ sampling beats and hooks to create an entirely new song. 
You won't be doing any new writing for this piece. You may revise, if you would like. But you are not going to be doing any new drafting whatsoever. The entire focus of this project is on structure and how it can be used to create and recreate meaning.
The Re-Mix Essay must:



Be composed of short (1-2 paragraphs max) UNALTERED sections of previously-written texts rearranged to form a new piece
Be a minimum of three pages
Include a minimum of one piece of line poetry
Include a minimum of one piece of prose
Include a minimum of three total pieces
Include at least two citations included in previous works

As we begin to think about this idea of ""research,"" it is a good idea for us to first locate ourselves within the idea. As you have read in the overview for Unit 3, scholarly research can take on a much, much broader arena than you may have previously thought. You don't have to be a Stuffy Academic TM in a White Lab Coat TM to do research- research can help you in whatever field that you choose to go into, and can even help you in non-professional settings. 
Let's take a quick look at a couple ways of looking at research that could be useful to you if you're going into fields where you won't be that Stuffy Academic TM. Particularly, we're going to look at one video that gives an overview of Narrative Inquiry, and another one that looks at  Action Research. Both of these research stances could be useful to you in this unit, so make sure to pay attention!
TASK

Research Strategies: Narrative Inquiry
What Is Action Research?



WRITE



A 100-word reflection on these two videos that answers the following questions

How does what I watched relate to things I've seen in the past or not?
How were my understandings of research challenged or upheld in these videos?
How might these ideas of research be useful to me in college, or after I leave college?
What types of research might I do in my eventual career, or my personal life, given my new understanding of it?
Who benefits from an understanding of research as inaccessible and exclusive?

We've been talking about research in class, but for you to really understand the ways that research can impact daily life, we need to see it. The Advocate, on its face, is a story about a man who gave up a life in academia to take up a life of action- of putting his lack of money where his mouth was and following a calling to do more. However, I would argue that Maurice Young actually never gave up academia. He just took it to its true potential. He never gave up research, he just brought it Home.
As we are rethinking research, I want you to do two things: First, I want you to think about what Maurice is doing and how research is an element of his work. What aspects of his advocacy (the action phas) would be impossible without first digging in, finding out, and learning? What parts of this movie (the reporting phase) would be impossible without that? Why did he choose this particular type of learning rather than another type? Second, I want you to think about yourself in relationship to Maurice's work. How does this relate to where you see yourself and the problems that you see yourself solving for your own Home?

As you've now learned through the Action Research viewing, in a research process there is ""reflection,"" then ""learning,"" then ""planning,"" then ""action"" and finally ""reflection"" again. These stages don't have to happen exactly in order, and undergo what's called a recursive or continually overlapping back over each other process... just like all writing processes!
One thing that often gets lost in several of the steps, however, is one of the most crucial aspects of doing effective research that can make a difference. Often, when researching, we become obsessed with a problem. That is, after all, what we're trying to solve. Why wouldn't we focus on that? However, one of the most important steps to solving a problem is identifying what you can do to solve it. And you can't solve a problem without certain tools, resources, people, institutions, etc. How would you solve homelessness without homes? Hunger without food? 
So for this reading, we're going to focus not on our problems, but on assets. There will be a video on something called asset mapping that will give you some perspective on what types of assets you should think of and if you take Action Research out into the world with you (which I encourage you to do, as it is a powerful problem-solving tool) ways to uncover those assets that might otherwise be invisible from your perspective but obvious from others' perspective. You'll then see an example of an asset-based organization doing great work in Indianapolis, the Kheprw Institute. Identify ways that they are identifying and utilizing assets to solve problems in Indianapolis. How can you use what they do as a model for solving the problems you want to solve in your own community?
Don't forget to think about assets as much as, if not more than, your problem when you are in your learning phase of research, and identify those assets in your writing to demonstrate to your reader that your solution is realistic!

Aaron Wilder,Annotated Bibliography/Draft 1 of Research,5.0,0.004775549188156638,0.07163323782234958,2022-10-31 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As we learned in Unit 2, Annotated Bibliographies can serve many purposes. This time, they will be a way for you to allow the voices of others to help guide your writing. We are, for the first time in this course, expected to allow the voices of others to assist in a very real way in developing our thoughts and our arguments, and an annotated bibliography is one of the best ways for us to do that because it allows you to see your interpretation of those ideas in something like paragraph form in front of you. Therefore, the ""first draft"" of your research project will be in annotated bibliography form (MLA).
This particular annotated bibliography does not have to, and should not, be in alphabetical order. It is a way for you to design your research, so keeping them in alphabetical order like some annotated bibs ask you to do doesn't make all that much sense. I would encourage you to not forget our mapping metaphors that we've been talking about in the annotated bibliography for Unit 2. Though we are foregrounding others' words rather than physical places, that concept still applies. Think about where you are beginning- what does your audience need to know before you introduce the assets/problems? How can you take them from that introduction to the solution, and help them imagine a world where that solution is implemented? Your annotated bibliography can be seen as sort of Google Maps that takes your reader through a route that ends with them being convinced to get on board with solving this problem your way. And as we go along, we'll do some exercises to help you see that route more clearly, see where you've missed steps in the directions that you need to go back and find, and see where your voice can take the reader through this research.
I highly encourage the use of mla.org's interactive practice template for this assignment, as well as software designed to assist in these types of projects such as Mendeley or Endnote. Do not use easybib or another online citation generator. There are quality levels to these types of programs- their algorithms can be more or less accurate, and most of the common ones are quite literally wrong more than they're right.
TASK
Your annotated bib should:



Be in MLA format
Contain at least three citations
Contain at least one scholarly citation relevant to the problem you want to solve
Contain at least one ""popular"" citation relevant to the problem that you want to solve
Be in an order that you believe will be effective in creating an argument for your reader



Your annotations should:



Immediately follow the appropriate citation
Summarize the primary information contained in the source
Evaluates the relevancy and credibility of the source
Provide a brief interpretation of how this source will function within your research project

You have now created a draft of your research paper. And, as we've discussed before in this class, writing is not simply the act of putting something down on paper... that's drafting. Writing is just as much, if not more, reading your own work with a critical eye, getting the input of others, and revising and re-envisioning that work with a keener eye on your purpose and audience, as well as the myriad ways you can achieve that purpose for that audience. 
However, as novice writers you are likely not all that familiar with that process. While professional writers spend up to 90% of their time in the revision stage, novice writers tend to only go through 1 or 2 drafts. So, one of the things that we are going to do is help you to create a revision plan, or a template for how you can undergo the revision process as you move forward. 
The revision plan template is very simple, and it may look very familiar to you. It is similar, of course, to the Peer Review form that you've completed each time we've been moving into the Portfolio phase of a unit. That's because I'd like to direct your eye to some of those same places-- not to things like punctuation and nit-picky little things, but how effectively am I bringing an idea to an audience that I understand with a chance to move them toward some action. What is that idea, and how can I sharpen it? Who is that audience, and how can I understand and speak to them in a way they will value? What is my purpose, and how can I move my audience toward it?
These are the questions of revision, and they bring in some of our big ideas from the rest of this semester:

Language varieties/Discourses
Structures
and, especially, Rhetorical Choices

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.



Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

We have been working through this research assignment for two weeks now, and it has become time for it to take shape. You have been working either in opposition to or directly from a problem that you stated you wished to solve in your Writing Assessment Essay, and have been through a Reflection process, including a revision plan. You have been through a Learning process, including creating an annotated bibliography to help you identify gaps in your research and provide a framework upon which it could proceed. Now, it is time to add your voice back into the process, and create a complete draft of your project, which is a form of the planning process. 
Like all research, we have to provide some framework for it to exist. And for this, we are going to go with the standard ""academic"" framework for your piece. You can make determinations about the audience for this piece, but I want at least part of your audience to be an academic one. If you believe that a better audience to help you solve your problem would be a popular one, don't worry- there will be time for that piece in your Final Portfolio, as well.
TASK
You will create a minimum four-page research paper that will adhere to the following guidelines:



The writing must seek to introduce, and then provide some at least partial solution to, a problem that you see in your ""home.""
The writing must include reference to ""assets"" that this community has, and seek to utilize them within the solution
The writing must include references to ""needs"" that this community has and how they relate to the problem/solution
The writing must demonstrate the ways that you will be involved in implementing this solution. This should be a realistic solution to a problem that you have the capacity to be a part of the change. And you can be a part of solving huge problems, if you can identify your role in solving them.
The writing must demonstrate the ways that research will be an ongoing component discovering and implementing a solution. See the Action Research and/or Narrative Inquiry videos earlier for guides on what these research processes can look like, and ""The Advocate"" for a model on what this can look like in practice.
The writing must include a minimum of four citations in MLA format, following the guidelines below:

A minimum of one scholarly citation such as a journal article, book, or study
A minimum of one CREDIBLE popular citation such as a newspaper article, tweet, or other piece emerging from the community themselves
A possibility for primary resources such as interviews with community members, direct observations, etc.





The writing's format must adhere to the following guidelines:



Begin with an Introduction that will inform the reader of what types of information they are about to read, characterizes the community and their assets/needs, etc.
Include a discussion of the problem that identifies the problem itself and how it manifests within the community. This should include citations that help the reader to understand the problem and its context.
Include a discussion of the solution that identifies the actions the author will take, personally and communally, to help to resolve the problem, how you are involved, and how research can play an ongoing role in the solution.
End with a conclusion that wraps up the big ideas and helps the reader to understand the totality of the writing
Be in MLA format

This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this unit and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
I want you to first look backward through each of your previous preflections and reflections, the assignments you've completed, and all of the work you've done so far this semester. This unit, as you know from the introduction, will be different. We'll be taking that work that we've done and then developing it into something that we can be proud of, something that represents all of that work in writing as a Final Portfolio. That means that everything you've learned so far this semester is integral to how you can develop that portfolio.
Then, given what you've seen and how you've seen yourself developing throughout this class as a writer and student and individual within our community of writers, think ahead to this unit. What do you see for yourself in the next four weeks? What types of work that you've learned how to engage in will you utilize most heavily? What actions will you take? What lessons will you implement? Then, dive into the preflection.
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

We don't get a second chance to make first impressions in person, and the same goes for writing. Opening sentences and page 1's are where authors throw it all on the page, setting the stage for what will come in the next dozens or hundreds of pages. They're short on story and big on setting, character, powerful word choice and evocative imagery. They, often, are meant not to begin telling the story itself, but bring the reader into the mood of the story. From ""Call me Ischmael"" to ""Mother died today"" to ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" even opening lines have been given elevated status in literary history. Who, after all, after having read Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God doesn't remember ""Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board."" Does it introduce us to the story? No. History? No. Character? No. But does it evoke something true and emotional and raw in us? Does it build a mood? Absolutely. That's what you'll be doing for YOUR page 1.
This project is meant to build DIRECTLY from your ""I Am From"" piece. You should select pieces of your ""I Am From"" that you believe will allow you to tell a story that in some way matters either to you or someone else (it can be fiction, but a non-fiction story might work better, especially one that relates somehow to language, culture, or your home!) and continue to develop them into prose, expanding upon them and adding more and more detail until you get to a minimum of one full page, double-spaced.
TASK

WRITE



My Page 1.



In a minumum of one page (but don't go more than a few sentence over!), you will bring your reader into a world that you occupy. Your task is not to introduce your reader to you, but to build a mood, set a scene, and stir emotions while nothing in particular is happening necessarily. No plot. No stories. No movement. Just setting the table for your reader through sensory description and perhaps dialogue. Then, in the final sentence or two, introduce yourself as a character in some way.
Tools to aid you:
Description:

Sensory information- try to get all five senses involved!

What kind of lighting? Where is the light coming from? Is it reflecting off anything or distorted in any way? Lighting often is a very predominant indicator of mood. Bright sun can be oppressive or warming, a cloudy day can be like a comforting blanket or foreboding.
What kind of sounds? Crickets, or factories, or traffic, or waves? Where are they coming from? Do they seem pure or distorted or filtered? Sound is often an indicator of how someone is interacting with their environment or their feelings of being at home. We've all been in a place where the sounds are new and it's a bit disconcerting, and we've all become accustomed to sounds in our homes that otherwise might be disconcerting.
What does this world feel like on your skin? Lips? What does your hair feel like? This sensory input is also very akin to their comfort and emotional state, something your reader can easily interpret through this sensory description.
What does this world taste like? Tastes are often indicators of places that we just were. Right now, I'm at a conference, and I can still taste the latte that I drank on the drive here- a common indicator that somebody is going to be diving into their day early in the morning- something your reader will almost definitely interpret from simply saying the taste of coffee was fresh on your character's tongue.
What does this world smell like? Smell is our most common connector to memory, even more so than sight, and as such can have a very potent connection to the emotions you can impart upon your reader.



Rhetorical Devices



Metaphor: Introducing a situation that is a metaphor for how you interact with the world, such as the hope embodied in ships approaching the harbor
Foreshadowing: Talking about something that will happen to your character. ""He didn't know that he would be up late that night, but that outcome was already determined.""
Dramatic Irony: Introducing some reality that your character will not or does not know about. ""The familiar face approaching around the broken-bricked corner of the building that was, twenty years ago, the dime store and still bore its name on the rotting wooden sign, was a familiar one. But no one in the square knew that yet. No one in the square knew a face approached at all. They laughed as if today was simply another day in their lives that they would log away like all the others...""
Something similar to dramatic irony that I call reverse-substantiation- providing evidence to support the conclusion that your character will draw very soon: ""The vial had turned bright red, a stark contrast from the deep blue of the reagent introduced in the early morning, the last time anyone had occupied this room. Test results happen that way- they become conclusive long before anyone is there to conclude anything at all."" OR ""Denny and Nordloff in 2019 concluded in their research that students from low-income families were being left out of the current writing centers paradigm. Victoria Purcell-Gates, all the way back in the 90's, found that students with a history of family illiteracy in Appalachia were victims of unrecognized linguistic discrimination by faculty as early as elementary. But still, one expects classrooms to feel welcoming- safe- sometimes despite a lifetime of experience to the contrary.""



Language



Which variety of English is going to most effectively bring your reader into your world? Is it that of ""academia,"" or is it the one that you hear and are familiar with in your home, in your neighborhood, in your specific interest, in your region? Would it be ""Each of these individuals is ill equipped for the challenge"" or ""y'all dunno da hell ya'll doin!"" BOTH CAN BE IMPACTFUL CHOICES- YOU SHOULD MAKE THIS CHOICE BASED ON IF THIS IS AN ACADEMIC AUDIENCE OR ONE OUTSIDE ACADEMIA
Do you have multiple Englishes to draw upon that you can integrate? Do you have languages beyond English that you can draw on that will help to set the scene, even for readers of English? Does it most matter if your reader understands the words themselves or the feelings they evoke? You are highly encouraged to incorporate your other languages into this piece!

So, here's the thing. You may have expected, in this writing course, to only be working with the black-on-white text that we call ""orthography."" But the reality is that we're going to be focusing much more broadly than that, and the field of writing encapsulates so, so much more than orthography. Let's say that you're creating a podcast, and you're telling a story. How are you going to plan out what you're going to say? You could of course do it on the fly, or think about it and try and memorize what you were going to say without putting it down anywhere. All of these things would've been what happened before the definition of writing, if you were going to record an anachronistic podcast. But far, far more likely for any scripted podcast or even a podcast that involves some basic level of planning is that you will utilize the technology that we call writing to facilitate the creation of the podcast.
You see, writing itself isn't a single thing, much the way that ""home"" isn't a single thing. It is a technology that facilitates our ability to effectively navigate LOTS AND LOTS of contexts. And any time that navigating the world can be more effective by placing something physically onto paper or metaphorically onto ""paper"" in a digital space, THAT is writing. 
One of the ways that we can communicate that can only tangentially be called writing is the use of images- and yet, it can absolutely be called writing in certain contexts. We're going to explore one of those contexts for this assignment- how can you effectively communicate who you are and what you call your ""home"" without including yourself or photos of others (as the focus),  and without orthographic text? I and your classmates will discuss the story that these photos, in their totality, including the way you arrange them on the page etc., can and do communicate to others, and if it is in line with your intended story. What do you think effects the stories that are being told? Why do these images communicate these things?
Think about objects/things that might connect to what you've already written about in your I Am From or your My Page 1! That will really help you to develop your ""Home That Built Me"" essay later!
TASK
You are going to allow objects, spaces and other things/places around you to speak for themselves when communicating who you are and what you call your home. You will create, using at minimum three photographs, some type of message that is meant to tell us about you and what you call home. There will be no people in these photos unless they're immaterial to the photo itself (like people playing in the park, but the park itself is the focus). You'll be sharing at least three photographs of:



One object. This is something of value to you that is self-contained, meaning it has some kind of boundary thats purpose is not to hold other things. It could be something like a shoe or a television or a ceramic statue of a toad performing brain surgery on a squirrel. Whatever you're feeling. Get creative. 
One space. This is an area bounded by some type of markers, be they geographic, physical, social, or other. This could be a room, a yard, a park, a hallway, a locker, etc. The purpose of these things is to be boundaries where certain types of activities occur. You wouldn't eat soup in the bathroom or do your taxes on the front lawn, for instance, but there are other things you would do there.
One other. This can be anything (appropriate for class) that tells us something about who you are, as long as there are no people included. 



There will be no orthographic text whatsoever allowed for this project.

We've been talking in class a lot about ""showing vs telling"" and the power of description. We've seen the ways that a simple photograph can ""construct an identity"" for the ""speaker"" as we refer to it in the discipline- ""tell people something about you"" in layman's terms. Now we're going to work on putting those things into writing in a format that is designed explicitly to help you construct an identity with vivid ""showing"" detail. The ""I Am From"" poem takes out the guess-work of structure and the ""what do I write about?"" and helps you to focus entirely on these things. What do I want my reader to interpret about me? What details can I include to give them this impression? How specific can I/should I be? It's a great opportunity to practice these skills in a way that we're going to be utilizing throughout this class.
TASK
Using the ""I Am From"" format found at the bottom of this poem, construct your own ""I Am From"" poem. The poem should:



Focus on what identity you would like to construct for your reader
Utilize highly detailed and specific sensory information to ""show"" this identity
Speak from the first person perspective
Utilize an English that evokes the identity that you wish to construct for your reader
Follow the format provided by the ""I Am From"" poem template (you will have the opportunity to alter it later if you'd like)

Aaron Wilder,Weekly Reflection,0.0,0,0,2022-08-29 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

Answer the following questions in your writing. I DO NOT want to see just a bulleted list of responses. This should be in paragraph form, and demonstrate that you're thinking about these things, not just dropping something there to have something written. Questions you MUST answer:



Go back to your Preflection. Tell me, what were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection?
How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations?
What did we do this week that most impacted you?

How does this relate to our course objectives (available in the syllabus and just below this text)?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Additional questions to consider this week:



How did our readings work together to paint a picture of language, its role in our culture, what shortcomings our cultural understandings of language might have, and what the consequences of those shortcomings might be?
How does our cultural understanding of language impact you, personally?



Your reflection must:

In our lives, there are times where we come upon someone for just an instant who has a huge impact on us, and then they disappear never to return. Likely, they don't even know the kind of impact they had on us, and never will. They likely never learned our name, and we never learned theirs. They may never think about us again. But we think about them often.
These people are often called ""Strange Angels,"" or people who, while their time with us was brief, their impact lingers. For this assignment, you will be writing a prose-like poem that tells the story of a strange angel
Contrasting with our Ode, which has a relatively rigid structure, this poem is designed to have a very loose structure much like the prose poems by myself and David Shumate. How do you think this might effect the ways that your reader can navigate the poem? The feelings that it engenders? How can you ensure that this is a prose poem rather than a brief letter or reflection? What structural or linguistic elements do you see in David's and my poetry that make it a poem rather than a short essay?
Beyond that loose mandate, the poem can read like a letter to the person, an internal reflection upon the ways they have changed your life, a piece to your future or present children about the ways small actions can have large effects, or many other things. The primary thing that I want you to focus on is the ways that the prose-like structure effects the readability in contrast to your Ode to an Intersection. 
TASK
Tell your audience the story of a ""Strange Angel"" from your life in a prose poem using strong nouns and verbs and descriptive language. Your poem should:



Be less than 3/4 of a page of prose poetry
Describe a very brief encounter, preferably one that can be measured in seconds
Focus on someone who you do not know intimately. Your mom is a regular angel, not a strange angel
Speculate on what is happening in their mind, as well as yours
Use vivid description including all five senses

In our exploration of the ways rhetorical decisions can have real-world impacts, we are going to begin working with two types of poetry which look to unite these ideas of space, description and structure. One of these genres is the Ode. Throughout the ages, poets have written odes to things of beauty. ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" by John Keats is one of the most famous, as is ""Ode to the West Wind"" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Odes can take many different forms, but share some qualities.

They speak directly to the subject of the poem, often something unable to speak or even understand, as a way to tell others of its greatness and communicate something larger about the world
They are line poems that incorporate regular line breaks
They are medium-long. These are not ten-line poems, but they're not T.S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" either.

While the language of the poets I've shared odes from above, from the middle of the 19th Century Romantic period, is very flowery and obtuse, I'd like you to write your ode in plain Englishes- whatever Englishes you expect that your chosen intersection would like to hear in an ode to itself. I know that my intersection- where the quiet entrance to my neighborhood exits onto the busiest road in my whole town- wouldn't want me to talk in some kind of academic-speak. It would feel talked down to, and it doesn't deserve that- also, it might just beat me up because as it looks now it's pretty neat, but it's definitely got a rough past. Instead I'd prolly have to talk like the people around it to avoid Discourse Tension and consequences that could damage our relationship.
TASK
Compose an Ode to an Intersection- and yes, I mean that literally. This ode should be dedicated to a literal intersection. Your ode should:



Be dedicated to a literal intersection
Be a minimum of one page
Be a line poem with regular line breaks
Include significant sensory description from all five senses
Seeks some type of larger conversation beyond simply appreciating this intersection



OBJECTIVES



Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion
Uses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes

For this end-of-unit reflection, we'll be doing the same exercise that we do every week. There are only 3 differences:

This reflection will be over the entire unit rather than a single week
This reflection will be a bit longer- about twice as long
A cleaned-up version of this reflection (modified to act as a bookend to your Artist's Statement) will appear at the very end of your Portfolio. 

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the last few weeks. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers. 
TASK
READ



University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection
Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
In paragraph form and in a minimum of 250 words, write a cohesive reflection on your work in this unit. Your reflective writing is an opportunity to look back at what we did in class during this unit, remind yourself of what happened, and then think more deeply about what we did, how it's meant to help you develop greater agency over your writing, and why these things might be important for you not just to pass your ENG 101/L01, not just to help you write in your other classes, but as a person hoping to make a difference in the world and leave it a better place through the guidance of the Franciscan Sponsorship Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and Reconciliation.
I should see you actively thinking and considering these things on the page. This is your fifth reflection this semester, so you've now had a bit of practice and gotten some feedback. Since this reflection is meant to be longer, it is also meant to reflect more deeply on the impact of the entire unit and how all of the pieces fit together. 
Questions you MUST respond to in this reflection:



Go back to your Class Preflection. Tell me, what were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection?
How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations?
What did we do this unit that most impacted you? Take a look back at the Canvas for this unit to help guide you in answering this question. Remember, this unit focused on:

 specificity in multiple forms: semantic (choosing words at the right ""level"" of specificity), historic (choosing language that emerges from a history that your audience will either share or appreciate) and communal (choosing language emerging from specific communities to which your audience belongs or will appreciate).
Descriptive linguistics: The idea that all languages are equally able to create meaning and that one version of English or other language is not somehow better than another. This is contrary to what Dr. Vershawn Ashanti Young calls ""dominant language ideology"" (111). We drew connections to the ways we really use language in the world (descriptive linguistics stance) rather than the way that our culture, and especially people who speak the dominant English (standard academic English or ""Broadcast English""), tells us it works (prescriptive linguistic stance).
Revision: You were also either introduced to or reminded of how revision can work to help you cultivate this specificity and make substantive and calculated transformations in your writing.


Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer? Be specific.
How does this relate to our course objectives (available in the syllabus and just below this text)?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Additional questions to consider this week:



How did the progression of our readings in this Unit work together? What story do you believe these readings and class lesson plans were trying to tell? Was it effective? Why/why not?
How did our progression of writing assignments in this Unit work together? What story do you believe they were trying to tell? Was it effective? Why/why not?
How do these ideas we've grappled with in this unit impact the ways you might interact with your peers and their writing?



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Be at least 250 words



OBJECTIVES



Substantiate ideas and statements to accomplish a purpose
Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives
Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion
Respond critically to readings and writers
Uses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the most effective possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task:

Include all of the things I ask from you
Showcasing each individual piece
Feel like a single, cohesive piece of art

You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
***IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are going to complete your portfolio on Google Docs, Word Online, or another online platform, make sure that I am granted access when you turn in the portfolio. If I can't grade your portfolio, I'll have to count it as either a late submission or as a 0, and neither of us want that***
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:
First: An Artist's Statement of at least 100 words (see link for help in creating artist's statement). An artist statement should:

Be in paragraph form
Introduce your perspective as the artist- who are you? What is your story? How does your identity/story relate to your art?
Let me know who your audience is for your art
Let me know what/who influenced your art
Develop some type of theme for your art
Let me know what I should be looking for in your art
Let me know what you hope your art accomplishes for your audience
Let me know why I should care about your art

Last: A 250-word reflective synopsis of what you've learned in this unit, including quotations and examples from your texts as demonstrations of that learning (for instance a quote from an original version followed by how that section ended up). This can and should be built from your Unit 1 Reflection. It should do the following:

Be in paragraph form
Let me know what your expectations were for this unit and how they were upheld/undermined. This should be directly quoted from your Class Preflection.

Pick up the theme from the Artist's Statement
How have you grown in your identity as a writer during this unit (or not)?

Where, in your writing, can I see your development as a writer as compared to your first drafts or the types of writing you might have done before this class? Quote them directly from your texts to show me this contrast, then let me know which focuses for this unit and/or course outcomes this learning relates to.
Imagine and describe a situation that might occur later in the course where you can apply this learning, and how. 
Imagine and describe a situation that might occur later outside of formal education where you can apply this learning, and how.
Reflect on why this learning is so critical for you, not only as a writer but beyond your identity as a writer in some way.


At any place between these two pieces- wherever it fits best, you should include:

Your Visual Identity Project
A revised version of your ""I Am From..."" poem
A revised version of your ""My Page 1"" .
A finalized version of your ""The Home That Built Me""

GRADING CRITERIA
Your portfolio will be graded using the rubric included in this assignment.
RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES



Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing

Aaron Wilder,The Naming Game,0.0,0,0,,"In class on 8/26/2020, we'll be playing a game to practice something called ""naming"" by writing scholars. It's the concept of calling things by not what they are often called, but what will bring about the intended understanding in the reader. For instance, we've all heard of the Shakespearean Insult Generator, right? Here are some of the Bard's most famous insults.
What do these insults have in common, besides being both hilarious and creative? Well, none of them are the common ways to refer to a person, and it's exactly their uncommonness and metaphorical connections that becomes so evocative and make such effective communication. 
Other iconic disses?
50 Cent: ""You a pop tart sweetheart, you soft in the middle/I eat you for breakfast""
Seriously not the same as: ""You ain't tough and I could beat you up""
Jay Z: ""So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong/You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song""
Seriously not the same as: ""I used your line better than you did""LL Cool J: ""You can't handle the whole weight/Skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate/Wise up, you little burnt-up french fry/I'm that type of guy.""Seriously not the same as: ""You should really invest more time in self-care.""Now that we've seen some naming in play, we're going to play a game and divide into groups of 3. Each group of 3 is going to take a single phrase from a sample of writing volunteered by a classmate for all of us to utilize and focus on naming. All groups will get one minute to confer before offering up their name for votes. The team that wins the popular vote for best Name will get one bonus point- ties will be broken by the tied teams offering a new name after a 15 second runoff period, which will then be voted on by all teams not competing in the tiebreak. We'll re-run this competition until we run out of time."

We're going to be doing a Works Cited page- for your portion of the class map.
You can find the main MLA page here, and an introduction on how to cite a google earth location here. But more important than the citation itself, I want you to create an Annotation. An annotation is a brief description of your source and how it relates the the greater work that you are attempting to accomplish with your writing. Annotations can serve many purposes, but for this project I want you to focus on how, exactly, this location is like a second home to you and how it contributes to your sense of who you are.

Cite the location. You can see, above, guidelines for completing this portion of your task.
Begin your annotation by summarizing the location's key characteristics. Use the naming skill we've been talking about in class to create an effective description. You don't need to necessarily describe everything about it. But you do need to describe the things that are most important to your sense of home, and your sense of who you are.
After you have described the location, tell us why it is important that you included it as one of only a few places you've shared thus far in the class. How has this place shaped you? How might you have been different if this place had never entered your life? Why, in other words, is it important to who you are?

The only  rules for this assignment are that you should highlight each of the foci below and that you must time yourself as you are writing, only allowing yourself one five-minute break during 30 minutes of otherwise nonstop writing (even if you hate what you're getting down on paper, or it's just gibberish).
Write in the language that you speak with your friends from these ""home"" locations for 30 minutes on the subject of language and home. Your writing should hit on at least the following items: 

What places were important to me as I grew up and what communities were present there? (utilize your annotated bibliography and cite those places... if you bring up new places, you do not need to cite them now, but you will need to eventually cite them in MLA and add an annotation as well)
Think about how you speak when you are around those communities, drawing on your experience with your dialogues. What are some things about your actual spoken language that stand out to you?

Kinesics is the study of how we move our bodies when we interact in different communities. How are bodies, their position, their posturing, their contact or lack thereof, important in those communities?
Sociolinguists are keenly aware of the ways that language communicates in-group and out-group status. What are some ways that your language use (including things like what your clothing communicates, what beliefs or ideas will be accepted and which won't be, when you're allowed to challenge someone and when you aren't, or other ""unwritten rules"") in these groups helps people know you're a part of the group, even if you've just met?
How does your home community's language use (including all of that ""other stuff"" we've been mentioning above and/or is mentioned in the reading linked above) look to other people? How does it appear to ""academia,"" or the ""professional"" or ""scholarly"" world?
How do YOU feel about your home language, including all of those things? Do you communicate that way everywhere? Why or why not?

They should be a greeting and brief conversation about any topic, but there are a few requirements:

The first dialogue should be between you and someone you consider yourself most ""you"" around.  Your mother, a best friend, your partner, etc. It should be glaringly honest- maybe even something that has actually happened when you greeted each other. It should take place in a location where you are free to be yourselves, where you feel comfortable. This can include profanity of any variety if it's something that the two would actually say- and it should be written in the way you'd actually say it (something that holds true for the rest of these dialogues, as well). For instance, my best friend and I might greet each other and have a brief, candid conversation like so:""Hey dude, what's up.""""Hey bro. Thanks for callin' me out yesterday.""""Wha?""""When we were in the car with my dad, and you gave me that look. That, like, 'you're effin' lyin'' look?""""OOOOOHHHH HELL. You think he noticed?""""Nah... He was driving. Also, he'on know what he's even doin', let alone anyone else.""""Loll""

The second dialogue should be between yourself and a random acquaintance- someone that you know, but don't know well at all- that you run into randomly in a public location like a grocery store or a concert. You feel as if you need to speak to them, but you're not nearly as comfortable with them as with your friend. How does your language use differ in this situation?

The final dialogue should be between you and a stranger whose opinion you highly value. Since we're on a Catholic campus, the example I often use is the Pope. However, this can be any highly respected and influential figure that you might feel somewhat in awe of getting to meet. Again, how does your language use differ in this situation?

 
Come to class prepared to share a little bit about these dialogues, and how they relate to ""home"" for you."

This piece will be worked into some of the things we've been doing in class, as well as your Unit 2 Portfolio. 

Whose values influenced the ways you view language, writing, and all of the things we've talked about that are wrapped up in it as that ""other stuff""?
What places do you call home that have influenced your linguistic identity? How have they done so?
How does your language relate to how you see yourself and your ""home"" and community/communities, and how you believe others see you, your ""home"" and your community/communities?
Overall, why do you interact with language/writing the way you do, and what forces do you think influence that?

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the best possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task- include all of the things I ask from you, and while showcasing each individual piece, also feel like a single, cohesive piece of art. You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:

At the front of the portfolio, an Artist's Statement of at least 100 words
At the end, a reflection of at least 100 words (can be very similar to your end of unit reflection)

At any place that fits best, a newly revised version of a piece from your Unit 1 Portfolio
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Ode to an Intersection""
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Strange Angels""
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Re-Mix""



GRADING CRITERIA
Your portfolio will be graded using this rubric

When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

Form a ""What"" question. This may be provided in the form of the weekly reflection topic, or you may have to create it yourself. Do not write it down in your response-- hold it in your mind. Examples are things like ""what was most valuable for me about this week, in class or something out of class that's related to writing or home?"" or ""What are any themes I'm noticing in class this week?"" or ""What is something that we didn't discuss this week that I wish we had""? Then, answer that question in one or two sentences as the first part of your critical reflection.
Form a ""How"" question that emerges from that original question. You should ask yourself- what ""how"" question am I left with after reading my own words?

What might someone who sees this situation entirely differently wonder about your statements? Don't ask the question in your response, just answer it in two or three sentences.
Form a ""Why"" question. This is a moment for you to interrogate your own words. Why did you respond this way? What values do you have that lead you to think this way, and are there other valid sets of values or thoughts that others could have, and why might they value or think differently? Don't ask the question in your response-- just answer it in two or three final sentences.

I know that this can be confusing. I've been wordy here, but that's on purpose. The purpose, here, is to make you think hard. I don't want this to be an easy, throw-away assignment. I want you to have to look inside of yourself and earn your words. I want to offer you a road map toward critical reflection, the process of answering not only the question in front of you, but the unasked questions that lurk behind it. To looking not only at yourself as you are, unexamined and unquestioned, but what alternative versions of yourself might look like in a different set of shoes.

In class this semester, we've gone through two phases and will be entering a final one. The first two we've talked about. They are: 

Complicating/searching for ""home""
Problematizing the home/language interrelationship

I've also talked a little bit about what we're going to be doing in this unit, Unit 3, which will be moving toward solutions. And let's be honest... these are huge problems that we're up against. Every single problem that we've talked about in class is deep-seeded with thick, interconnected roots that cling to bedrock. But as James Baldwin said, ""Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."" So, we're going to be facing these challenges head-on and looking at ways that we can begin to develop solutions.
Because, really, we had a preview of all of this in weeks 1 and 2. We talked about Desmond's complicated relationship with ""Home"" and talked about who we are in our Page 1, and looked at the Smithsonian's article on the origins of home and how they're a bit more complex than we may have previously thought. Then, we talked about the ways that not only is there a problem with the 4th Amendment (people without a physical space of ""home""... not aligning with our growing definition... are not protected by our founding document) but that this writing actively constructs our experience of the world and decides how individuals can be invited in or shut out in various ways based on wording, definitions, naming conventions etc.1  Then, we were all invited to take part in actively constructing our own classroom experience by proposing Amendments to the Syllabus- our founding document. In essence, you were using writing to create a solution to problems you identified in our classroom community.
And it's not just you guys. All around the world, people are utilizing language and writing as a means to ""write the world"" that they wish to live in. We've seen it based on the people who've been players in our classroom experience so far. From Maurice Broaddus' Afrofuturism to Maurice Young's Homeless Bill of Rights to Wildstyle Paschall's scathing historical review of The Ethnic Cleansing of Indiana Avenue, we've seen three incredible Black men fighting for the world they wish to see through writing and research. And now, we're going to focus in on the Near Northwest, and see more people utilizing language and writing and communicative arts and research to do powerful things within our community. Because Unit 3, as you've heard many times, is about solutions.
In this assignment, you're going to be investigating the how of arriving at solutions by taking a look at, and presenting about, one community organization that is utilizing writing, language, communication or research practices of some variety to write the world they wish to live in.
Content
There are a surprising number of organizations working toward different iterations of the future they wish to write in the Near Northwest of Indianapolis. Below, you will find a small sampling of them. 

The organization that Wildstyle Paschall is a member of, The Learning Tree and the immense amounts of projects that they oversee and take part in within the Near Northwest.
The organization that Maurice Broaddus is a part of, the Kheprw Institute (pronounced Keppra). They are located on the Near East Side but do a lot of work in the Near Northwest.

The Near Northwest is a ""Quality of Life"" organization comprised of neighbors and stakeholders (people who work or own in the area) working toward solutions in a variety of areas from Food Access (my area) to Housing to Community Safety to Parks and Public Spaces.

Flanner House is the oldest wrap-around services organization in the country, with its founding all the way back in the 1890's. Its genesis was during the era when Black residents could not get home loans or contractor's licenses or any number of types of access, so Black residents banded together to do things like build each other's homes and watch each other's children while they were working, grow and maintain food spaces, etc. They boast one of the oldest daycares in the nation as well, and a 1.4 acre farm within 2 miles of Downtown. They were one of the organizations booted off of Indiana Avenue by IUPUI in the 70's to their location where they reside today.

The Center for Leadership Development is a community organization dedicated to helping students from areas with low graduation rates get to and through college, among dozens of other ventures. They are located right across the street from Flanner House on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street.

Groundwork Indy is an organization dedicated to ecological education for residents of the Near Northwest, focusing on students between the ages of 15 and 18. They have their hands in an uncanny amount of ecologically-related initiatives around the Near Northwest, and regularly host writing-related workshops on their site off of Burdsal Avenue.

What You Will Contribute to Class
For your contribution to class on Friday, 10/23, you will provide a 2 minute introduction to one specific program from the organization you've chosen. This introduction should address the following:

What is your organization and the name of the program/initiative
Where is this organization located and where does the initiative focus
What is the problem this initiative is meant to address
How does this initiative address the problem

You will then allow the following one minute for questions from your peers. You will not go over three minutes total. It will be tight on time and I'd like to have a large group discussion of at least a few minutes after, so I'll be timing you and cutting you off at 3 minutes. Please rehearse at least once prior to delivery to make sure you stay within the time frame. 
Footnotes:
1. Bad news about the 4th Amendment, btw. My legal scholar friends have told me that because of centuries of legal precedent wearing away at it including rulings on the Patriot Act and a really interesting case involving a bugged phone booth where federal agents got around needing a warrant by placing the microphone on the outside of the booth but within their capacity to hear both parties in a conversation within it, the 4th Amendment is, as several of them quoted directly ""a legal fiction"" and agents of the state can essentially gather information on you or break into your home and do whatever whenever as long as it is considered ""reasonable"" by a very, very loose standard established in precedent. Hooray..."

Then, on Monday, 10/26, you created your first draft bringing this conversation into writing. Now, I want you to undertake the process of re-envisioning you work. Remember the elements that we've been talking about in writing:

Naming
Show/Tell
Structure
Purpose
Audience

Begin to envision how these rhetorical choices can build your piece into something that fulfills its purpose of informing the reader about these initiatives, as well as whatever other purpose you want the writing to undertake.

What You Will Submit
Your second draft does not have to be a completed document, but it should begin the process of risk-taking to help a document find itself. What is this piece? Is it a collaborative effort between image and text to convey a feeling of this event? Is it a news article meant to provide information so others can get involved? Is it a manifesto about the strength of a group of people that incorporates audio of their voices to showcase them and be about them? A reader should begin to see the soul of the document developing in this second draft.
Missteps are okay, and even encouraged in this stage. You still have an entire draft left to turn in, and there is no penalty for doing something that doesn't quite pan out! Try some stuff! Get wild! See what you can get away with! Boldness will be rewarded."

Form a ""What"" question. This may be provided in the form of the weekly reflection topic, or you may have to create it yourself. Do not write it down in your response-- hold it in your mind. Examples are things like ""what was most valuable for me about this week, in class or something out of class that's related to writing or home?"" or ""What are any themes I'm noticing in class this week?"" or ""What is something that we didn't discuss this week that I wish we had""? Then, answer that question in one or two sentences as the first part of your critical reflection.
Form a ""How"" question that emerges from that original question. You should ask yourself- what ""how"" question am I left with after reading my own words? This is your opportunity to analyze not only what is seen in the way you respond, but what is unseen? What might be left out of this conversation? What might someone who sees this situation entirely differently wonder about your statements? Don't ask the question in your response, just answer it in two or three sentences.
Form a ""Why"" question. This is a moment for you to interrogate your own words. Why did you respond this way? What values do you have that lead you to think this way, and are there other valid sets of values or thoughts that others could have, and why might they value or think differently? Don't ask the question in your response-- just answer it in two or three final sentences.

I know that this can be confusing. I've been wordy here, but that's on purpose. The purpose, here, is to make you think hard. I don't want this to be an easy, throw-away assignment. I want you to have to look inside of yourself and earn your words. I want to offer you a road map toward critical reflection, the process of answering not only the question in front of you, but the unasked questions that lurk behind it. To looking not only at yourself as you are, unexamined and unquestioned, but what alternative versions of yourself might look like in a different set of shoes. Not only looking at the world as it is, but an alternate world that could be and whom that world might benefit that this one does not.If you have questions, I'm more than happy to guide you through this process. Let my responses to your first critical reflections guide you-- I tried to use them to push you forward in your responses.
This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is one-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help you grow, not to turn out a product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one, and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur."

Throughout this unit we have worked with this concept of ""research."" We've delved into, first, how a process of action on the part of Maurice Young in the short documentary The Advocate could, in certain ways, be described as research in action. We then looked at that type of research, Action Research, among other types to demonstrate that research doesn't have to be all white lab coats and pipets or google searches and loneliness. It can be dynamic and curious and come with a punch of real-world action. And finally, we talked about three types of sources- Individual/anecdotal, communal/news, and conversational/scholarly- and spoke with Lynne Colbert from the Mother Theresa Hackelmeier Memorial Library about ways to leverage campus resources in our pursuit of those sources. And through it all we were putting in some writing time moving from research about homelessness to research about solutions within the Near Northwest, and, finally, the opportunity to think about how you're going to take what you know back to your home communities and make an impact on the ways language can help others in your community.
This reflection is an example of Writing to Learn. I don't care if it feels messy or if there are misspellings or things don't exactly seem to pan out. What I do want to see is you thinking deeply through text about the linguistic and research-based topics we've covered in this unit and how they relate back to this theme of ""home"" we've been exploring all semester. Below are some questions to help get you started.
Instructions
This reflection should be in paragraph form, not as a sequential answer to each question. The What/How/Why questions are designed to get you thinking, not to give you a series of three separate prompts. When you're answering each of these questions, your reflective writing should flow together into a unified paragraph.
Answer the questions ""What, How, and Why"" relating to this unit in a minimum of 250 words. To do this, follow these steps:

Form a ""What"" question. Do not write down your ""what"" question. Hold it in your mind. Examples are things like ""what was most valuable for me about this week, in class or something out of class that's related to writing or home?"" or ""What are any themes I'm noticing in class this week?"" or ""What is something that we didn't discuss this week that I wish we had""? Your writing should begin by answering that question in two or three sentences.
Form a ""How"" question that emerges from that original question. Do not write down you ""how"" question. Let it, and your response, emerge from the ""what"" question and answer it in writing as you continue to move down the page. If you are stuck and a ""how"" question doesn't come immediately to you while writing, reread your previous 2-3 sentences. Then ask yourself- what questions am I left with, as a reader, after reading my own words? This is your opportunity to analyze not only what is seen in the way you respond, but what is unseen? What might be or might have been left out of this conversation or unit, or the ways you've responded to it? What might someone who sees this situation entirely differently wonder about your statements? Your writing should continue by answer one or more of these questions in two or three sentences.
Form a ""Why"" question. Do not write down your ""what"" question. Let it, and your response, emerge from the writing you've already done as you progress down the page. This is a moment for you to interrogate your own words and focus on both introspection- why did I respond this way in this unit- and extrospection- why does the world set itself up this way, or why has this situation arisen? You should be asking yourself those critical questions of who is heard/unheard in my interpretation, who benefits/loses out from the way I'm seeing this unit, what ideological frames are given space/denied space? What values do you have that lead you to think this way, and are there other valid sets of values or thoughts that others could have, and why might they value or think differently? Don't write these questions in your response. Take 2-3 final sentences to answer one or more of those questions that come to mind as you wrap up your reflection.

Grading Criteria
Grades for reflections are completion grades. If you complete your 250 word reflection, you will receive full credit of 5. If you complete a reflection, but fail to meet the word count, you will receive either 2 or 3 points. If you do not complete your reflection by the due date, you will receive a 0. 
How To Submit
Type your reflection in the submission window and click ""Submit"" when you are satisfied with your response. You will see the number of words as you type in the submission box. "
Aaron Wilder,Writing Assignment Draft 1 Due 11/2: Problem/Solution in My Community (Draft 1),2.0,0.0019102196752626551,0.028653295128939826,2020-11-03 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
This writing builds upon the previous two assignments you completed to move you from a place where you are reporting about events, to applying imaginative and analytic thinking to turn over the ways that what you've learned in this class can lead to a positive linguistic impact in your own community.
First, you have looked at different types of inquiry and examined the ins and outs of an extended movement for the betterment of a very specific group of people related to our theme of ""home."" Maurice Young took the time to understand and listen to people around him, and then took it upon himself to be a part of the solution, taking very specific tactics and taking part in very specific writing tasks (the Homeless Bill of Rights) to make change. This provided us a pattern- Learn, listen and understand; Plan and strategize; Take action; Analyze the effects of your action; Reflect on your action and the effects of your action; Learn, listen, and understand again as the process begins over. 
This pattern that Maurice Young took reflected a specific type of research that we looked at- Action Research. And so, we learned, that research can take many forms and doesn't have to be this intimidating thing done in white lab coats. We learned even more about research from Lynne Colbert, and then undertook your second research project in this unit, where you each looked up examples of particular initiatives related to language, learning and literacy happening right now or in the near past in your neighborhood of the Near Northwest. 
Hopefully, these examples of what research and action can look like have inspired you and provided an even greater template for the ways that you can make a difference on a language and/or literacy concern that you have for your community. You've been practicing what we've called ""proto-research"" and learning about the different types of problems that can manifest in language all semester, and now you've investigated what different types of solutions can look like. You are ready for this. You've already Learned, listened to writers from the NNW, and taken steps to understand language as it really exists, not as we tacitly understand it. Now, it's time to Plan and strategize.
Instructions
For this assignment, I want you to think about a language-related problem in one or more of the places that you call ""home."" This solution can be enacted now, as you are currently, or as some aspirational version of yourself when you've completed your degree 3.5ish years from now. As you are constructing your plan I want you to think about/do the following:

Analyze your own assets. What is your major, and how can it be applicable to language/literacy? What types of knowledge do you possess now or will you possess after completion of your degree? What are your aspirations for your life, and how can that be applicable? What traits, gifts, or other types of assets do you have available to you that you could mobilize?
How will you mobilize these assets? One asset you have gained over this semester is linguistic knowledge. What others can combine with that to build your solution?
Who is the group that can be supported by these assets? What assets are they likely to possess that can be mobilized? For example, if you hope to change the linguistic opinions and teaching of educators in your community, how can you leverage what they already do well to move them toward your goal?
What values do you and the group you hope to support share that you can call upon? Shared values and Discourse can be a powerful asset in creating change, as we have seen.
What tactics will you use to make the change? Conversations? Community-building? Pressure? Shame? Writing? Visuals? What will you do to reach this goal?
What will success look like for you? 
Most importantly, you can't do this yourself. What other types of people will you need on your team, and what types of assets will they bring toward your solution? 

Grading Criteria
This draft will be graded on completion. Like the rest of the writing faculty here, I believe in ""[crappy] first drafts."" That means this is an opportunity for you to take risks, just get your thoughts and possibilities and worries down on paper so that I can comment on them and you can read them and your peers can read them so that in draft 2, they can be sorted and re-imagined, and then refined for your final draft in Portfolio 3.
Take-aways
From this assignment, I want you to understand that you can make a difference. You are, as they say, capable of ""writing the world."" Your words matter, your thoughts matter, and your actions matter, and if you apply them you are capable of doing things, even small things, that will make the world a better place. This assignment is practice for that.
I want you to recognize that crazy ideas not only are okay, but are the way bold and beautiful things happen. There was a time, before linguistics, when no one thought about examining language at all. Someone had to think- ""you know what, I do this thing every day but have never taken the time to really think about it."" There was a time when no one had ever thought to use, not pictures, but abstract symbols relating to sounds, for the purposes of communication. Then, they had to teach other people how to use them. Both of those things, at the time of their invention, would have been absolutely bonkers ideas. But now they are the entire basis of your semester.
Don't be afraid of crazy ideas. Instead, learn, listen and understand; Plan and strategize; Take action; Analyze the effects of your action; Reflect on your action and the effects of your action; Learn, listen, and understand again as the process begins over. "
Aaron Wilder,Writing Assignment Draft 2 Due 11/4: Problem/Solution in My Community,2.0,0.0019102196752626551,0.028653295128939826,2020-11-05 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
The purpose of creating a second draft, as with every second draft we have undergone in this class, is to have a chance to radically re-imagine your writing and the ways it can interact on the page with a reader. This is an opportunity to shift your focus from simply getting your thoughts down on paper to what effect does this have on a reader?
Since this draft is also a completion grade, it's another opportunity to take risks while thinking not about yourself and your thoughts, but your audience and theirs. What moves can you make that will influence a reader's understanding and experience of your writing? How can you utilize the type of writing that you are undertaking (aspirational research, in this case) to influence your writer's thinking and understand what your plans are and how they'll be impactful? To support your cause? To join your organization? Whatever your purpose for this aspirational research writing is. 
Instructions
I want you to radically rethink the ways that your writing can exist in relationship to your audience. To do that, we've investigated three key facets of written communication that you can leverage:

Show vs Tell: While research writing is a primarily telling genre, there will be key moments where showing can be very powerful for a reader. Think about what those moments might be for your writing and how you can do that to greatest effect.
Naming: While this type of writing (generally) won't incorporate super creative naming choices (unlike our conversation related to the Op-Ed style of writing discussed in your previous project), naming will still be a key facet of helping your reader develop meaning through your text. Look at the ways you use nouns and verbs, and ask if you can be stronger with your usage. Hunt down adverbs and adjectives to see if a stronger noun or verb could eliminate them. Give your reader the most evocative language appropriate for your purposes.
Structure: We have talked about two types- Sentence structure and Paragraph structure- as ways to use structure to build meaning in your writing. What are these types of structure saying in your writing? Do they make your content readable? Do they communicate the mood and tone of your writing to the reader? How am I using not just text, but white space on the page to my advantage? Can I use any non-text information such as breaks with separating items like asterisks or lines, or even images to my advantage? 

Grading Criteria
While this is a completion grade, when I score your Unit 3 Portfolio, as I've mentioned, there are 8 points assigned to Process. This means that while you won't be scored on the ways you revise your work here, you will eventually be graded on that, so it behooves you to look at your second and third drafts as an opportunity to work on developing your pieces. "
Aaron Wilder,Unit 3 Portfolio Draft Due 11/6,40.0,0.038204393505253106,0.5730659025787966,2020-11-07 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
Like every other portfolio you've turned in in this class, the Unit 3 Portfolio is a chance for you to demonstrate the ways that you've applied what we've learned in class to your writing projects. As we've discussed many times in class, the measure of a writer is not how cleanly they can get words down on paper the first try, but the process by which they move from concept to polish. The best writers, in other words, are not those who can vomit most efficiently onto the page, but those who are the most tenacious, stick with it the longest, apply their learning, and come to a final product conscious and confident of its eventual impact on the audience.
This portfolio's intent is outlined in the course syllabus, and is meant to demonstrate your ability aligning with the following General Education Objectives:
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes;
And Course Outcomes:
a. Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
b. Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
c. Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
d. Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .
You have, throughout this unit, been asked to interpret meaning from different information mediums like text, audio, video and image, as well as a range of information presentation types from maps to articles to documentaries. You've been asked to communicate within a range of purposes, from informative research to inquiry to opinion to persuasion, all within the ""research"" genre. 
You have been asked to utilize various techniques discussed in class such as showing/telling, naming and structure, as well as a range of evidence strategies from emotional/logical to anecdotal to communal to scholarly. Your audiences have been both academic and non-academic, they have required multiple perspectives and critical inquiry into who benefits/is left out, who gets to speak/is silenced, and what ideologies are present/ignored. And, through your reflective writing, you've been asked to reflect on how these writings bear upon your ideas of research, language choices, writing, and our ever constant theme of ""home.""
We've been working on this all semester working up to the three assignments in this unit, and you are now prepared to demonstrate that learning through this Unit 3 Portfolio. 
Instructions
In a single document, you will combine the following writing projects
First- An Artist's Statement, designed to prepare your reader for what they will be reading. This should set me up to view the rest of your portfolio through the lens you'd like me to see it. Do you want me to see your growth as a writer? Do you want me to see the way you've really attacked ""naming"" as a strategy? Do you want me to see the contrast between the different types/genres of research writing you've undertaken? Set me up to read it that way not just with your words, but with good writing that utilizes the very strategies we've been talking about all semester from naming to showing vs. telling to meaning-making structure, and even references to the text if that will be helpful. 
Next- In whatever order you deem most appropriate for the way you'd like me to read your Unit 3 Portfolio:

Your submission to the Class Discussion Reflection Topic: What Can I Do?

Your final draft of the Homelessness Research Assignment
Your final draft of the What Are Our Communities Doing Assignment
Your final draft of the Problem/Solution in My Community Assignment


Last- Your Unit 3 Reflection. If you need to edit this for submission, you may. It should work as a bookend to your Artist's Statement, telling me not what should I expect but what learning did I just witness in these pages?  I should leave the final section of your portfolio feeling that I understand what growth you have undergone as a writer and thinker in these past few weeks, and why that growth is a valuable asset to you. 

Grading Criteria
There are 40 total points available for the Unit 3 Portfolio, broken up into 5 categories of 8 points each. These categories follow the values set forth by your instructor from the very beginning of the course.
8 Points for Process
 I should be able to look back at your Draft 1 of each of your works and see a concerted effort and movement in each of the pieces. Evidence that you've tried out new things and made significant effort to see where your writing can take you in developing your piece toward its final draft is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
8 Points for Rhetorical Effectiveness
I should be able to see the meaning that you are working toward, and see the ways that the choices you've made in writing are meant to lead your intended audience toward your purpose. This is the does your writing do what you want it to criteria. Evidence that your writing has a clear purpose, intended audience, and follows the expectations of that audience in ways that are beneficial to effectively ""moving"" them is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
8 Points for Structural Soundness
I should be able to see that you are intentionally utilizing structure as a meaning-making tool. While readability is absolutely a top-notch concern here, for full credit in this category I want to see that the sentence, paragraph, page etc. structure you've chosen is a conscious- not unconscious- method of ""moving"" your audience in line with your purpose.
8 Points for Linguistic Choice and Efficacy
This absolutely does not mean that you must use *Standard English in your writing. What it does mean is that the linguistic choices that you make- from Naming to Show vs Tell to the use of that ""other"" language in your writing like ands, buts, thoughs, howevers etc. are conscious- not unconscious- choices meant to ""move"" your audience in line with your purpose.
Response to Prompt
To receive full credit in this category, each piece must effectively respond to the prompt in its entirety. This does not always mean direclty answering every question in the prompt. It does, however, mean writing along the subject lines the prompt asks for, writing in the genre the prompt asks for, and following any guidelines set forth by the prompt. 
How to Submit
Submit your portfolio as a single document attachment with page breaks between each piece of writing you submit.
One final bit of advice: While you definitely want to let me know which piece in your portfolio is which, creating TITLES are a huge help toward building a full piece of writing! Titles are the first thing a reader sees when they open up your document, and ""Unit 3 Portfolio"" is not nearly as compelling or as effective at providing a reader an effective starting point as ""It's Alive: Research in the Real World through a College Freshman's Eyes"" and ""Homelessness Research Project"" is not as emotionally thwacking as ""When Your City Doesn't Want You"" or ""Solidarity Beneath Davidson Street."""

Earlier in the year, you created an amendment meant to assist in ""writing your world"" in a way that will benefit you in this course. This demonstrated that writing is actually the means by which we build our experience. After all, our social contract is actually a written document. Your course syllabi which create the terms by which you experience your college experience are written documents. The student handbook that sets the terms by which you are able to experience your life on campus and off is a written document. Your housing contract is a written document. Our lives are already written. This is simply an opportunity for you to take control of that writing, and therefore an aspect of your life.
Just like before, this is a moment you are required to build an Amendment to the syllabus. You now have some context for your experience in the course, and may have a firmer grasp on what may benefit you as we move into the last unit of the course. Moving forward, there will be less take-home work as well, so this may be an opportunity for you to put that work into something other than completing work due right now, like the opportunities available to you for extra credit.
Instructions
Follow the instructions in the syllabus to create an amendment to the syllabus
Grading Criteria
You will be graded on whether you successfully complete the requirements to create an amendment to the syllabus. "
Aaron Wilder,Writing Assignment: Rhetorical Inquiry,5.0,0.004775549188156638,0.07163323782234958,2020-11-13 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
You may or may not know that we just finished a presidential election. As such, you've been for the last year or more likely inundated by political advertisements, news, ""horserace journalism,"" and other forms of communication with a wide range of purposes. While we often think of political advertisements as an attempt to persuade an audience's vote, that is not always the real purpose behind these ads. For this assignment, I want you to investigate, among other things, what the ""underlying purpose"" of these ads are.
During this class, we have utilized a particular approach to uncovering the ""underlying purpose"" of various types of communication that seem to have a clear, overt purpose. Most notably, we looked at maps and determined that, despite their reputation of communicating factual information in an objective manner, maps have an underlying purpose that may be, as we discussed with Lynne Colbert form the Mother Theresa Hackelmeier Library, factually true, but functionally either ambiguous or outright false. An example are the maps that placed the Crimea either firmly in the control of Russia or the Ukraine, when the reality is that this territory is in a fuzzy in-between state right now. We noted that for these maps, no one had consulted the actual people who live and work and spend their lives there. We noted that for these maps, there was no possibility offered of a ""neither"" option, but a forced dichotomy between these two powers. And we noted that this map seeks to uphold a concept called the ""nation-state,"" which is the preferred governmental style of our era, but which has not always existed and almost certainly will cease to exist sometime in human or world history. Which brings us to the approach we utilized: Critical Inquiry.
Critical Inquiry breaks down into the process of asking incisive questions about a piece of communication to look beneath the text. It helps us to see not what it purports to accomplish on its surface, but what it accomplishes in reality. It is one of more than a few methods of accomplishing this task, such as the CRAPP method discussed with Lynne.
A refresher on the Critical Inquiry process we utilized in class. To follow this process, you'll need to answer three questions:

Who gets to speak in this piece/who is silenced?
What perspectives are offered here/which are ignored?
What ideologies are presented here/which are ignored or outright demonized?

A refresher on the CRAPP Test:
Currency: How timely is the information, and how does its timing relate to its purpose?

Relevance: Are the assertions of the communication actually applicable to what it is asking of you?

Authority: Who is the speaker/author of this communication, and are they likely to actually be able to effectively speak on this situation? Do they have the necessary training or knowledge to interpret and communicate not only factually true, but functionally true information on this subject in this instance? Do they have motivation to provide you with information that my be either factually or functionally untrue?

Accuracy: Does the author/speaker of this communication have a reputation for truth? Is the information supported by the evidence, and can you verify it in multiple locations from multiple, credible locations? Does the language seem consistent with not only factual, but functional truth? Are there any spelling, typographic, or grammatical errors (not just non-standard English, but actual errors)? Is this a disputed claim by reputable persons? Is there context that may pose a functional challenge to this claim?

Purpose: What did you uncover in your critical inquiry that could inform both the explicit and implicit purpose of this communication? To inform? To create a strong emotional reaction like fear or anger? Are there political, ideological, cultural, religious or personal biases that you can uncover? 

If you take anything from this course, I would like you to take the ability to parse fact from fiction in communication. Importantly, when I say this, I mean not only factual truth, but functional truth. 
I want you to understand that this skill is most important not for communication you are predisposed to disagree with (that process is easy) but for information that you agree with. That is the communication you are most likely to take at face value, and therefore the information most likely to deceive you.
I want you to take this perspective out into your lives and develop your ability to utilize it for all communication that you encounter. If you begin using this process now, you will get better and better at it. Eventually, it will become easy, and even second nature. You will have honed your ability to parse information looking for that which you should trust- the most important skill of the information age.
Instructions
I want you to look at a news source where you are likely to encounter information that confirms your existing perspective. I want you, view it not just once, but three times.

On your first viewing, simply read the article or view the communication in its entirety, without any analysis. I want you to simply let it wash over you emotionally, and afterward reflect on which emotions you have experience. Write a short paragraph about this emotional reaction.
On your second viewing, read the article or view the communication and identify the claims made in the communication. A claim is a statement that is meant to be taken as fact, but provides the opportunity to be factually true (or not) and functionally true (or not). Do not analyze these claims at this time, simply list them.
On your third viewing, I want you to apply the Critical Inquiry process and the CRAAP test to a minimum of three of these claims. This should take the form of a piece of formal writing in Standard Academic English.

You will provide, in your final document, three sections to your writing.

A link to the communication you have chosen to view. I will need to be able to view this in order to provide feedback for you.
Your list of claims (minimum of three, though you should include all claims you recognize in the communication you choose).
A minimum one page analysis of, at minimum, three of the claims you have listed at the top of your document. This portion of your document should be written in Standard English.
A minimum 150 word reflection on what you learned from this assignment about evaluating sources.

Grading Criteria
While the grade for this project is solely for completion, I will be evaluating you on whether or not you include all four required pieces of this assignment and your sincere attempt to analyze a piece of communication that you agree with. Arguments such as that there is no ideology present or other types of non-effort will not be rewarded with a positive score. For you to agree with the communication, there must be ideology present. In fact, it is impossible for communication to be ideologically neutral. Claiming otherwise means you have not effectively analyzed this communication. 
How to Submit
Submit a single document that includes all four required sections."

Throughout this course we have worked with the intertwining concepts of ""home"" and ""language,"" sometimes smashed together into this idea of ""Discourse,"" ""Home Language,"" ""Englishes"" or ""Literacies."" We've delved into, ""What is Home?"" before looking into the fraught relationships around language and home, before then bursting out into how we can utilize language and writing as a means of action to remake our home in ways that we hope will benefit that home and the world. Along the way, we've learned about Naming, Show vs. Tell, Structure as a meaning-making act, Research as learning enmeshed with action, and more. We've read from successful writers who live life just a few miles from us (Maurice Broaddus, author of Buffalo Soldier, lives on Indianapolis' east side and works at Ujamaa Bookstore despite a writing career that more than keeps the lights on. Some of you may have met him there!).
Now, I want you to look back on all of those experiences I just summarized- many of which needed to be omitted for the sake of space (remember, what is not there or what is left out are just as important and meaningful as what is put in writing)- and put down in writing the ways that you have changed through this process.
This reflection is an example of Writing to Learn. I don't care if it feels messy or if there are misspellings or things don't exactly seem to pan out. What I do want to see is you thinking deeply through text about the topics we've covered and the actions we've taken in this course and how they relate back to this themes of ""home"" and ""language"" we've been exploring all semester.
TASK
This reflection should be in paragraph form, not as a sequential answer to each question. The What/How/Why questions are designed to get you thinking, not to give you a series of three separate prompts. When you're answering each of these questions, your reflective writing should flow together into a unified paragraph.
You will write a minimum of two full pages, reflecting back on the course content and the themes of ""home"" and ""language."" The reflection will be focused on concrete actions throughout the course, and how those concrete actions have led to learning and growth for you as a writer, thinker, student, and human. The reflection should focus on how your work in this class met the objectives/outcomes for the course, and ask yourself the critical questions that we have been working on throughout this class:

How have I demonstrated, through writing and class discussions, that I've grown in the following course objectives?

Substantiate ideas and statements to accomplish a purpose
Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives
Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion
Respond critically to readings and writers
Uses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes


How have the assignments I've completed challenged me toward these outcomes?

Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences
Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences
Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it
Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .


Who do I/have I let speak, and whom do I/have I silenced? And why did I make those decisions in my writing and classroom discussions?
What perspectives do I/have I allowed to influence me, and what perspectives do I/have I ignored? Why did I make those decisions?
What ideological frames do I/have I allowed space in my understanding of the world, and which do I/have I ignored? Why did I make those decisions?

Things you can think through that might help you respond to the objectives/outcomes/critical questions can be found below:

Did this course provide you with access to voices, perspectives or ideologies that you had not heard before or did not know were there to be heard?
Did it ignore other voices/perspectives/ideologies that you wish you heard more from?
Did you feel that your voice/perspective/ideological frame was represented in the course, and if so/not, how or how not?

GRADING CRITERIA
Grades for this reflection will be based upon completion. If you complete your 2 page reflection, you will receive full credit of 20. If you complete a reflection, but fail to meet the word count, you will receive either 10 or 5 points. If you do not complete your reflection by the due date, you will receive a 0.
Please note that a version of this Reflection is required as part of the Final Portfolio, where it will not be graded as completion, but based upon whether is has met the criteria above! 
HOW TO SUBMIT
Type your reflection in a word document or other supported word processer. Save it, and upload it by clicking the ""Browse"" button and finding it in your files. Then, click ""Submit"" when you are satisfied with your response. You will see the number of words as you type in your word processer. "

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the best possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task- include all of the things I ask from you, and while showcasing each individual piece, also feel like a single, cohesive piece of art. You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:

At the front of the portfolio, an Artist's Statement of at least 100 words.

Remember that the ""theme"" for this unit was Discovery and Rhetorical Choices, but we picked up themes from Unit 2 (Structure) and Unit 1 (Specificity) as well.

At the end, a reflection of at least 100 words (can be very similar to your end of unit reflection)

At any place that fits best, a newly revised version of a piece from your Unit 1 Portfolio
At any place that fits best, a newly revised version of a piece from your Unit 2 Portfolio
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your Unit 3 Research Project



GRADING CRITERIA
Your portfolio will be graded using the rubric included in this assignment.

We don't get a second chance to make first impressions in person, and the same goes for writing. Opening sentences and page 1's are where authors throw it all on the page, setting the stage for what will come in the next dozens or hundreds of pages. They're short on story and big on setting, character, powerful word choice and evocative imagery. They, often, are meant not to begin telling the story itself, but bring the reader into the mood of the story. From ""Call me Ischmael"" to ""Mother died today"" to ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" even opening lines have been given elevated status in literary history. Who, after all, after having read Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God doesn't remember ""Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board."" Does it introduce us to the story? No. History? No. Character? No. But does it evoke something true and emotional and raw in us? Does it build a mood? Absolutely. That's what you'll be doing for YOUR page 1.
TASK
READ



2 books near you. Do not read past page 1 today, no matter how tempted you are



WRITE



My Page 1.



In 150 words or less, you will bring your reader into a world that you occupy. Your task is not to introduce your reader to you, but to build a mood, set a scene, and stir emotions while nothing in particular is happening. No plot. No stories. No movement. Just setting the table for your reader. Then, in the final sentence or two, introduce yourself as a character in some way.
Tools to aid you:
Description:

Sensory information- try to get all five senses involved!

What kind of lighting? Where is the light coming from? Is it reflecting off anything or distorted in any way? Lighting often is a very predominant indicator of mood. Bright sun can be oppressive or warming, a cloudy day can be like a comforting blanket or foreboding.
What kind of sounds? Crickets, or factories, or traffic, or waves? Where are they coming from? Do they seem pure or distorted or filtered? Sound is often an indicator of how someone is interacting with their environment or their feelings of being at home. We've all been in a place where the sounds are new and it's a bit disconcerting, and we've all become accustomed to sounds in our homes that otherwise might be disconcerting.
What does this world feel like on your skin? Lips? What does your hair feel like? This sensory input is also very akin to their comfort and emotional state, something your reader can easily interpret through this sensory description.
What does this world taste like? Tastes are often indicators of places that we just were. Right now, I'm at a conference, and I can still taste the latte that I drank on the drive here- a common indicator that somebody is going to be diving into their day early in the morning- something your reader will almost definitely interpret from simply saying the taste of coffee was fresh on your character's tongue.
What does this world smell like? Smell is our most common connector to memory, even more so than sight, and as such can have a very potent connection to the emotions you can impart upon your reader.



Rhetorical Devices



Metaphor: Introducing a situation that is a metaphor for how you interact with the world, such as the hope embodied in ships approaching the harbor
Foreshadowing: Talking about something that will happen to your character. ""He didn't know that he would be up late that night, but that outcome was already determined.""
Dramatic Irony: Introducing some reality that your character will not or does not know about. ""The familiar face approaching around the broken-bricked corner of the building that was, twenty years ago, the dime store and still bore its name on the rotting wooden sign, was a familiar one. But no one in the square knew that yet. No one in the square knew a face approached at all. They laughed as if today was simply another day in their lives that they would log away like all the others...""
Something similar to dramatic irony that I call reverse-substantiation- providing evidence to support the conclusion that your character will draw very soon: ""The vial had turned bright red, a stark contrast from the deep blue of the reagent introduced in the early morning, the last time anyone had occupied this room. Test results happen that way- they become conclusive long before anyone is there to conclude anything at all."" OR ""Denny and Nordloff in 2019 concluded in their research that students from low-income families were being left out of the current writing centers paradigm. Victoria Purcell-Gates, all the way back in the 90's, found that students with a history of family illiteracy in Appalachia were victims of unrecognized linguistic discrimination by faculty as early as elementary. But still, one expects classrooms to feel welcoming- safe- sometimes despite a lifetime of experience to the contrary.""



Language



Which variety of English is going to most effectively bring your reader into your world? Is it that of ""academia,"" or is it the one that you hear and are familiar with in your home, in your neighborhood, in your specific interest, in your region? Would it be ""Each of these individuals is ill equipped for the challenge"" or ""y'all dunno da hell ya'll doin!""
Do you have multiple Englishes to draw upon that you can integrate? Do you have languages beyond English that you can draw on that will help to set the scene, even for readers of English? Does it most matter if your reader understands the words themselves or the feelings they evoke?



OBJECTIVES



Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion
Uses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes

We've seen the ways that a simple photograph can ""construct an identity"" for the ""speaker"" as we refer to it in the discipline- ""tell people something about you"" in layman's terms. Now we're going to work on putting those things into writing in a format that is designed explicitly to help you construct an identity with vivid ""showing"" detail. The ""I Am From"" poem takes out the guess-work of structure and the ""what do I write about?"" and helps you to focus entirely on these things. What do I want my reader to interpret about me? What details can I include to give them this impression? How specific can I/should I be? It's a great opportunity to practice these skills in a way that we're going to be utilizing throughout this class.TASKUsing the ""I Am From"" poem you worked on in class construct your own poem. It does NOT have to say ""I am from"" or have that title. The poem should: Focus on what identity you would like to construct for your readerUtilize highly detailed and specific sensory information to ""show"" this identitySpeak from the first person perspectiveUtilize an English that evokes the identity that you wish to construct for your readerFollow the format provided by the ""I Am From"" poem template (you will have the opportunity to alter it later if you'd like)OBJECTIVESSubstantiate ideas and statements to accomplish a purposeCreate voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasionUses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes"

Exploratory Drafts will become something you'll do for every large assignment in this course. Their purpose is not to create something perfect or even something acceptable, but rather to simply create something. This is a moment for you to, as Ms. Frizzle says, ""make mistakes, take chances, and get messy!"" Try things out. Feel out your thoughts. See what's going on in there, and... explore. You will absolutely not be graded upon your ability to write something ""perfect"" on your first try. You will, however, be graded on whether you tried.
""The Home That Built Me"" is an exploration into the ways that linguistic identity, writer identity, and environment interplay. You'll use the content that you've created so far through your My Page 1 and I Am From writings as a starting point for this essay, and build from there using the attributes of Discourses we can glean from our readings. This will be an exploration of who you are in language, and perhaps your first opportunity to look deeply at the ways that your environment and the ways you identify through language relate. As we've said before, these things are the water in which we swim, and are therefore often completely unexamined in our lives- and that's where some connections that can be highly illuminating may be able to hide. It's your job to work toward making those connections in this assignment.
TASK
Create a draft of an essay that begins the process of exploring the relationship between the spaces you consider ""home"" and your linguistic identity, using the lens of Discourse(s) to assist. It should adhere to the following criteria to be considered a success:



Your draft should demonstrate the beginnings of a piece that will end at a minimum of 4 pages
Your draft should incorporate and built on some of the elements present in previous essays
Your draft should begin to draw on ideas from the readings, incorporating the language of and touching on the concept of Discourses:

ways of speaking
ways of listening
ways of reading and/or writing
ways of acting
ways of interacting
ways of valuing
ways of feeling
ways of dressing
ways of thinking
ways of believing


Your draft should include at least one image
Your draft should utilize appropriate Englishes or other languages to evoke intended audience

Research in learning has routinely shown us that learning is much more complicated than simply looking at and digesting information. To learn material so that you are capable of applying that learning in new situations, there are significant hurdles to that acquisition, then detection of moments when the learning is truly applicable, electing to utilize that learning in this moment, and finally reflecting upon that learning to decide not just that you will utilize it, but how  you will adapt it to this new scenario.  One of the models for this that has proven most effective is the following:

This means that before you undertake a learning opportunity such this week of class, you will be looking forward to the learning moment and think about what you might be asked to do/learn and take an honest look at your current understandings of the subject and expectations. You must then attend class, of course. But after class, you should review what took place in class and reflect upon its impact and the ways it fits in with other learning.
This assignment begins this three-part framework for the week. I can't really structure your study (other than building in writing assignments) or your accessing your learning in other learning scenarios, but I can create a preflection, learning and reflection dynamic. And this assignment is the first step in that dynamic- this preview or preflection stage of the learning process.
TASK
In 100-250 words, answer the simple question below in either a spoken (video or audio recording format) or written format:



Based on the knowledge and experience I have at my disposal now, what do I expect from this week of the course, and from where do I think those expectations emerge?



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

On Monday, we were introduced to the concept of Discourses. Today, we're going to continue to explore that concept in an article that's a decent bit more ""academic"" in its language. There are probably going to be a few things in there that you're not going to follow, and that's perfectly fine- this piece is built for professors who are looking to get better in their teaching practice. But the biggest thing here for you to see is the list of things that the author brings into their definition of Discourse- ""ways of speaking, listening, reading, and/or writing integrated with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing-"" and the ways that these Discourses can have a documented impact on the ways that we, as humans, interact with each other and the types of outcomes that can emerge when there is unexamined ""Discourse tension"" in a classroom setting.

So, here's the thing. You may have expected, in this writing course, to only be working with the black-on-white text that we call ""orthography."" But the reality is that we're going to be focusing much more broadly than that, and the field of writing encapsulates so, so much more than orthography. Let's say that you're creating a podcast, and you're telling a story. How are you going to plan out what you're going to say? You could of course do it on the fly, or think about it and try and memorize what you were going to say without putting it down anywhere. All of these things would've been what happened before the definition of writing, if you were going to record an anachronistic podcast. But far, far more likely for any scripted podcast or even a podcast that involves some basic level of planning is that you will utilize the technology that we call writing to facilitate the creation of the podcast.
You see, writing itself isn't a single thing, much the way that ""home"" isn't a single thing. It is a technology that facilitates our ability to effectively navigate LOTS AND LOTS of contexts. And any time that navigating the world can be more effective by placing something physically onto paper or metaphorically onto ""paper"" in a digital space, THAT is writing. 
One of the ways that we can communicate that can only tangentially be called writing is the use of images- and yet, it can absolutely be called writing in certain contexts. We're going to explore one of those contexts for this assignment- how can you effectively communicate who you are and what you call your ""home"" without including yourself or photos of others (as the focus),  and without orthographic text? I and your classmates will discuss the story that these photos, in their totality, including the way you arrange them on the page etc., can and do communicate to others, and if it is in line with your intended story. What do you think effects the stories that are being told? Why do these images communicate these things?
TASK
You are going to allow objects, spaces and other things/places around you to speak for themselves when communicating who you are and what you call your home. You will create, using at minimum three photographs, some type of message that is meant to tell us about you and what you call home. There will be no people in these photos unless they're immaterial to the photo itself (like people playing in the park, but the park itself is the focus). You'll be sharing at least three photographs of:

One object. This is something of value to you that is self-contained, meaning it has some kind of boundary thats purpose is not to hold other things. It could be something like a shoe or a television or a ceramic statue of a toad performing brain surgery on a squirrel. Whatever you're feeling. Get creative. 
One space. This is an area bounded by some type of markers, be they geographic, physical, social, or other. This could be a room, a yard, a park, a hallway, a locker, etc. The purpose of these things is to be boundaries where certain types of activities occur. You wouldn't eat soup in the bathroom or do your taxes on the front lawn, for instance, but there are other things you would do there.
One other. This can be anything (appropriate for class) that tells us something about who you are, as long as there are no people included. 

There will be no orthographic text whatsoever allowed for this project.

When you think of ""home,"" what do you think of? I'm sure that, for many of us, it is a physical structure and we are pretty dang sure that that's the thing that home means. We even have terms for people who don't have that- homeless. But one theme that you are going to notice in this course is that when things seem obvious, that is exactly the moment that we need to engage our critical questions to further examine that topic because not many things are as simple as they seem.
One place we will routinely visit to illuminate difficult or seemingly simple topics that are likely much more complex are histories. Histories can provide us glimpses into the world before this concept, and what conditions were brought together to bring this concept into the world. And this is what we will be doing with this first reading. How did the concept of ""home"" come to be? And, more importantly, what don't we already know about this concept that might shift our understanding of it?

When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

KC Chan-Brose,CLASS READINGS: Navigating Discourse,1.0,0.0011947431302270011,0.02031063321385902,2022-08-30 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As we've been talking about the spaces around us, we've been slowly working toward making the connection back to how these things relate to our language and relationships to learning and writing. Now, these two things are going to slam squarely into each other for this reading, using the concept of discourse/Discourse. As James Paul Gee (Links to an external site.), the linguist who first described the concept of Discourse, said, if I am to speak in ""perfect"" English as I walk into a predominantly white, male biker bar in West Virginia, I will not only immediately be noticed as out of place but further be immediately unable to effectively navigate this situation. As described earlier, writing is a tool that allows us to more effectively navigate situations (in writing often called contexts, and while Gee and then Madjidji here will be predominantly referring to speaking in these writings, these things also apply in different ways to writing). So, if my language has made it more difficult for me to navigate this situation, how could it possibly be described as ""perfect""?
But it goes deeper. Let's say that I am very familiar with the speech patterns of predominantly white male bikers in this portion of West Virginia, and as I walk in I speak the language of the moment absolutely perfectly. But, I'm wearing a three piece suit and wiping my mouth with a red, silk handkerchief. 
Clearly, communication is not just about the linguistic patterns used. And that's what this piece (written by an undergraduate student from University of Pittsburg, no less) will delve into. But more importantly, it will delve further than that- into the ways that these Discourse patterns can have distinct and noticeable impact upon the ways that we can more or less effectively navigate the world, in which spaces and situations we feel comfortable, etc.
When you read this piece, reflect upon yourself. In what spaces do you feel most comfortable, and how do you think that the relationship between your primary or ""home"" Discourse(s) and the Discourse of other spaces where you feel less comfortable might impact those feelings and your ability to effectively navigate within those spaces?
TASKS
READING

Suci Madjidji, ""Navigating Discourses"" (Links to an external site.)

WRITING

First, read this essay with the critical questions in mind:



Who gets to speak in this piece, and who is silenced? What perspectives am I not seeing?
Which stakeholders' voices are present here, and whose voice is either spoken for (accurately? Inaccurately?) or not heard at all?
Who benefits from this communication? Who loses out from this communication?


Second, write a brief reflection responding to at least one of these critical questions

As we are building up our ability to tell our story of our home(s), there are some genres that are highly illustrative of the tools available to us. Poetry is one of those genres, because quite often, poetry eschews the narrative and expository elements of writing that are often fore-fronted in other genres. So while we are entering this place, we're going to take a look at a good bit of poetry that does exactly this. Some of these poems will even be examples of the ""I Am From"" poem that we will be writing in class to provide you with a template for the work you'll be doing yourself.

Research in learning has routinely shown us that learning is much more complicated than simply looking at and digesting information. To learn material so that you are capable of applying that learning in new situations, there are significant hurdles to that acquisition, then detection of moments when the learning is truly applicable, electing to utilize that learning in this moment, and finally reflecting upon that learning to decide not just that you will utilize it, but how you will adapt it to this new scenario.  One of the models for this that has proven most effective is the following:

This means that before you undertake a learning opportunity such this week of class, you will be looking forward to the learning moment and think about what you might be asked to do/learn and take an honest look at your current understandings of the subject and expectations. You must then attend class, of course. But after class, you should review what took place in class and reflect upon its impact and the ways it fits in with other learning.
This assignment begins this three-part framework for the week. I can't really structure your study (other than building in writing assignments) or your accessing your learning in other learning scenarios, but I can create a preflection, learning and reflection dynamic. And this assignment is the first step in that dynamic- this preview or preflection stage of the learning process.
TASK
In 100-250 words, answer the simple question below in either a spoken (video or audio recording format) or written format:

Based on the knowledge and experience I have at my disposal now, what do I expect from this week of the course, and from where do I think those expectations emerge?

There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

I have a paid subscription to it because I use it so much, but it's available for free and you won't lose out on any quality in the content you make. If you like another way of making videos, you can use that too, of course. This video should provide some insight into ways that you identify that you are comfortable sharing with the class- identities such as ""an athlete"" or ""a student"" or ""nerd,"" a ""man,"" ""woman,"" or ""nonbinary,"" as ""Black,"" ""Latino,"" or ""white,"" as ""LGBTQ"" etc. etc. Anything that you feel embodies the ""you"" that you want to share with the class. This video should also include some key information about a place that you think of as ""home,"" which doesn't have to be the physical place where you have laid your head at night, but can be the places that are most valuable to you and helped to make you who you are today. Finally, it should include some kind of interesting story from your past that you feel helps to embody who you are. Think about ways to make these videos radiate your personality, and how to connect with your audience. If you're bubbly and happy, put something bright and colorful in your background and make sure to have your best bubbly voice and face on for recording. If you feel as if you're a hard worker, maybe take the video of you while you're nose-deep into the grindstone and end with ""but now I've gotta get back to work.""

KC Chan-Brose,"Class Reading 9/30: Buffalo Soldier, Chapter 1",0.0,0,0,2022-09-30 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
When we first looked at Maurice Broaddus' Buffalo Soldier, we stopped before entering page 2. In that first page, we were treated to around 200 words of description and place-making, opening questions like ""what does the word 'sacrament' mean here?"" and ""what are chiba leaves?"", meandering through his mother's stories of duppies (what are duppies?) and Old Higue hanging ""her skin along the branch of a cotton tree before she went about her grim business."" It's not until we get to the last line that we get a reference for all of these details... they relate back to the place that Desmond Coke calls home- Jamaica- and his reminiscing of it from ""under the strange western sky.""
However, all of the intricate details of this page are only the introduction to the way that Broaddus weaves specific details through his work to help bring the reader into the story. In chapter 1, you will see phrases like ""Bulbous, bloodshot eyes, like ebony marbles swimming in a skim of yellow"" and ""mud-sluiced street."" These details are not just occasional, they are constant, and in this reading I want you to take intimate notice of them. Then, I want you to imagine the reading without them. Imagine ""The drunk man watched me"" instead of ""bulbous, blood-shot eyes, like ebony marbles swimming in a skim of yellow, tracked him."" Imagine ""the town was dirty"" instead of ""mud-sluiced street."" 
Because all of these things are examples of showing rather than telling on page 15 of the book. Showing allows us, as readers, to experience these sensations as we would in life with all their power, right alongside those within the pages. In life, there are no flashing signs that say THIS TOWN IS UNSAFE. And yet, we immediately gather how unsafe Desmond and Lij are as they enter the town, even if perhaps they don't quite grasp it yet.  

Rather than telling us that the man who confronts Desmond and Lij is drunk, Maurice Broaddus shows us with his actions and description of him. ""Alcohol wafted on his breath."" The color and look of his eyes. His face ""pocked and rugose."" All of these are characteristics of drunkenness, along with his unprompted aggression with ""You got something to say?"" and blocking their path, clearly looking for a fight. 
Rather than telling us ""this town is a dirty, rough, unsafe place,"" Maurice Broaddus shows us through this interaction with the first man they come across, through the ""mud-sluiced streets,"" the ""accumulated stares"" from people, the ""giant steammen"" at patrol dotting the border.

Your exercise for this reading will be to attempt to recognize the impact of specific detail, specifically moments of showing through description in Chapter 1 of Buffalo Soldier, imagine how what is being shown here would have been different if it were told instead, and, finally, to think about how you can apply this to your own writing that you are drafting right now, in this class.
TASK
The assignment has two primary steps: First, read. Second, respond.
READ: Buffalo Soldier, Chapter 1
RESPOND
Click the ""Next"" button to move to the post-reading quiz. As you're reading, be prepared to answer these three questions:



Quote one passage that demonstrates showing through description in Chapter 1
Imagine how what is being shown through description were told directly instead. What would it say? How would that change the experience for you as a reader?
Find a sentence or two in your writing where you are TELLING when you could be SHOWING. Rewrite the sentence(s) to show, rather than tell. Then think about how this effects the reader's experience.



HOW YOU WILL BE GRADED
A completed assignment will be awarded a score of between 1 and 5. 



5: You have satisfactorily completed the assignment and all of its attributes
2-4: You completed the assignment but missed one or more attributes I was asking for
1: You did something, though it wasn't really what I asked for.

We don't get a second chance to make first impressions in person, and the same goes for writing. Opening sentences and page 1's are where authors throw it all on the page, setting the stage for what will come in the next dozens or hundreds of pages. They're short on story and big on setting, character, powerful word choice and evocative imagery. They, often, are meant not to begin telling the story itself, but bring the reader into the mood of the story. From ""Call me Ischmael"" to ""Mother died today"" to ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" even opening lines have been given elevated status in literary history. Who, after all, after having read Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God doesn't remember ""Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board."" Does it introduce us to the story? No. History? No. Character? No. But does it evoke something true and emotional and raw in us? Does it build a mood? Absolutely. That's what you'll be doing for YOUR page 1.
This project is meant to build DIRECTLY from your ""I Am From"" piece. You should select pieces of your ""I Am From"" that you believe will allow you to tell a story that in some way matters either to you or someone else (it can be fiction, but a non-fiction story might work better, especially one that relates somehow to language, culture, or your home!) and continue to develop them into prose, expanding upon them and adding more and more detail until you get to a minimum of one full page, double-spaced.

WRITE


My Page 1.



In a minumum of one page (but don't go more than a few sentence over!), you will bring your reader into a world that you occupy. Your task is not to introduce your reader to you, but to build a mood, set a scene, and stir emotions while nothing in particular is happening necessarily. No plot. No stories. No movement. Just setting the table for your reader through sensory description and perhaps dialogue. Then, in the final sentence or two, introduce yourself as a character in some way.
Tools to aid you:
Description:

Sensory information- try to get all five senses involved!

What kind of lighting? Where is the light coming from? Is it reflecting off anything or distorted in any way? Lighting often is a very predominant indicator of mood. Bright sun can be oppressive or warming, a cloudy day can be like a comforting blanket or foreboding.
What kind of sounds? Crickets, or factories, or traffic, or waves? Where are they coming from? Do they seem pure or distorted or filtered? Sound is often an indicator of how someone is interacting with their environment or their feelings of being at home. We've all been in a place where the sounds are new and it's a bit disconcerting, and we've all become accustomed to sounds in our homes that otherwise might be disconcerting.
What does this world feel like on your skin? Lips? What does your hair feel like? This sensory input is also very akin to their comfort and emotional state, something your reader can easily interpret through this sensory description.
What does this world taste like? Tastes are often indicators of places that we just were. Right now, I'm at a conference, and I can still taste the latte that I drank on the drive here- a common indicator that somebody is going to be diving into their day early in the morning- something your reader will almost definitely interpret from simply saying the taste of coffee was fresh on your character's tongue.
What does this world smell like? Smell is our most common connector to memory, even more so than sight, and as such can have a very potent connection to the emotions you can impart upon your reader.



Rhetorical Devices



Metaphor: Introducing a situation that is a metaphor for how you interact with the world, such as the hope embodied in ships approaching the harbor
Foreshadowing: Talking about something that will happen to your character. ""He didn't know that he would be up late that night, but that outcome was already determined.""
Dramatic Irony: Introducing some reality that your character will not or does not know about. ""The familiar face approaching around the broken-bricked corner of the building that was, twenty years ago, the dime store and still bore its name on the rotting wooden sign, was a familiar one. But no one in the square knew that yet. No one in the square knew a face approached at all. They laughed as if today was simply another day in their lives that they would log away like all the others...""
Something similar to dramatic irony that I call reverse-substantiation- providing evidence to support the conclusion that your character will draw very soon: ""The vial had turned bright red, a stark contrast from the deep blue of the reagent introduced in the early morning, the last time anyone had occupied this room. Test results happen that way- they become conclusive long before anyone is there to conclude anything at all."" OR ""Denny and Nordloff in 2019 concluded in their research that students from low-income families were being left out of the current writing centers paradigm. Victoria Purcell-Gates, all the way back in the 90's, found that students with a history of family illiteracy in Appalachia were victims of unrecognized linguistic discrimination by faculty as early as elementary. But still, one expects classrooms to feel welcoming- safe- sometimes despite a lifetime of experience to the contrary.""



Language



Which variety of English is going to most effectively bring your reader into your world? Is it that of ""academia,"" or is it the one that you hear and are familiar with in your home, in your neighborhood, in your specific interest, in your region? Would it be ""Each of these individuals is ill equipped for the challenge"" or ""y'all dunno da hell ya'll doin!"" BOTH CAN BE IMPACTFUL CHOICES- YOU SHOULD MAKE THIS CHOICE BASED ON IF THIS IS AN ACADEMIC AUDIENCE OR ONE OUTSIDE ACADEMIA

Do you have multiple Englishes to draw upon that you can integrate? Do you have languages beyond English that you can draw on that will help to set the scene, even for readers of English? Does it most matter if your reader understands the words themselves or the feelings they evoke? You are highly encouraged to incorporate your other languages into this piece!

KC Chan-Brose,EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITY: Trip to Cleo's Bodega and Ujamaa Bookstore to get free coffee and pick up Buffalo Soldier,0.0,0,0,2022-09-03 01:01:01.000001,"5 BONUS POINTS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO ATTEND
PURPOSE
You are all, as you know, now members of the Near Northwest Neighborhood, which is really a collection of neighborhoods just northwest of downtown between 38th and 10th, Kessler and Meridian. And one of the purposes of this class is to help you discover, uncover, and more deeply understand communities that you are a part of through acts of inquiry, reading and writing. This is one such opportunity.
Flanner House has been a mainstay and rock within this community for more than 50 years, and is a central hub for much of the work that goes on within it. We'll take a brief tour of Flanner House, your professor will buy you coffee, and you'll get to see Cleo's Bodega (and hear its history), Ujamaa Bookstore (and hear its history) and purchase a copy of Buffalo Soldier, the only required text for this course. If we're lucky (and he is available), the author may even make an appearance at the bookstore to sign your copy!
TASK
Attend a 50 minute adventure on the Flanner House campus taking place BLANK. The class will meet at 11 a.m. at Cleo's Bodega. There are two ways to get there:
1. Via IndyGo Route 15, which will depart from the 30th Street and Cold Spring stop at BLANK. To attend in this manner, you should arrive at the stop no later than BLANK. Your professor will pay your fare both for the ride to Flanner House and your return ride, departing from Flanner House at BLANK.
2. Drive, walk, ride the bus, or otherwise make it to Cleo's Bodega by 11 a.m. and leave around 12 p.m.
3. Take part in a walk around Flanner House campus between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m., including Cleo's Bodega and Coffee Shop, Flanner Farms and Ujamaa Bookstore on the Flanner House grounds. This will include conversation about the histories of these institutions and how they relate or will relate to course content.
4. Record a brief reflection about your experience (will be done on-site)
HOW TO EARN BONUS POINTS
If you attend the day and aren't a jerk, you get 5 bonus points, plus a fantastic new place for you to call part of your neighborhood like a location for quick groceries, a fantastic coffee shop and off-campus study space, and a chill bookstore with lots of events by local artists and writers! 
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SAVVY STUDENTS
You may have noticed that many of the things on the above list are also cross-listed in your ""community gaming"" bonus points section of your syllabus. Yes, if you follow the guidelines for the community gaming bonus points, these bonus points will ""stack"" with those, as well. By my math, you could earn as many as 10-12 bonus points by attending and taking advantage of this tour!"

So, here's the thing. You may have expected, in this writing course, to only be working with the black-on-white text that we call ""orthography."" But the reality is that we're going to be focusing much more broadly than that, and the field of writing encapsulates so, so much more than orthography. Let's say that you're creating a podcast, and you're telling a story. How are you going to plan out what you're going to say? You could of course do it on the fly, or think about it and try and memorize what you were going to say without putting it down anywhere. All of these things would've been what happened before the definition of writing, if you were going to record an anachronistic podcast. But far, far more likely for any scripted podcast or even a podcast that involves some basic level of planning is that you will utilize the technology that we call writing to facilitate the creation of the podcast.
You see, writing itself isn't a single thing, much the way that ""home"" isn't a single thing. It is a technology that facilitates our ability to effectively navigate LOTS AND LOTS of contexts. And any time that navigating the world can be more effective by placing something physically onto paper or metaphorically onto ""paper"" in a digital space, THAT is writing. 
One of the ways that we can communicate that can only tangentially be called writing is the use of images- and yet, it can absolutely be called writing in certain contexts. We're going to explore one of those contexts for this assignment- how can you effectively communicate who you are and what you call your ""home"" without including yourself or photos of others (as the focus),  and without orthographic text? I and your classmates will discuss the story that these photos, in their totality, including the way you arrange them on the page etc., can and do communicate to others, and if it is in line with your intended story. What do you think effects the stories that are being told? Why do these images communicate these things?
TASK
You are going to allow objects, spaces and other things/places around you to speak for themselves when communicating who you are and what you call your home. You will create, using at minimum three photographs, some type of message that is meant to tell us about you and what you call home. There will be no people in these photos unless they're immaterial to the photo itself (like people playing in the park, but the park itself is the focus). You'll be sharing at least three photographs of:



One object. This is something of value to you that is self-contained, meaning it has some kind of boundary thats purpose is not to hold other things. It could be something like a shoe or a television or a ceramic statue of a toad performing brain surgery on a squirrel. Whatever you're feeling. Get creative. 
One space. This is an area bounded by some type of markers, be they geographic, physical, social, or other. This could be a room, a yard, a park, a hallway, a locker, etc. The purpose of these things is to be boundaries where certain types of activities occur. You wouldn't eat soup in the bathroom or do your taxes on the front lawn, for instance, but there are other things you would do there.
One other. This can be anything (appropriate for class) that tells us something about who you are, as long as there are no people included. 



There will be no orthographic text whatsoever allowed for this project.

Just a reminder that, throughout this class, we will be utilizing a format of ""preflection, attend, reflection"" that will bookend each week, mimicking the best practices derived from educational research. The model we pull from is: 



Preview
Attend
Review
Study
Assess



This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this week and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

We've been talking in class a lot about ""showing vs telling"" and the power of description. We've seen the ways that a simple photograph can ""construct an identity"" for the ""speaker"" as we refer to it in the discipline- ""tell people something about you"" in layman's terms. Now we're going to work on putting those things into writing in a format that is designed explicitly to help you construct an identity with vivid ""showing"" detail. The ""I Am From"" poem takes out the guess-work of structure and the ""what do I write about?"" and helps you to focus entirely on these things. What do I want my reader to interpret about me? What details can I include to give them this impression? How specific can I/should I be? It's a great opportunity to practice these skills in a way that we're going to be utilizing throughout this class.
TASK
Using the ""I Am From"" format found at the bottom of this poem, construct your own ""I Am From"" poem. The poem should:



Focus on what identity you would like to construct for your reader
Utilize highly detailed and specific sensory information to ""show"" this identity
Speak from the first person perspective
Utilize an English that evokes the identity that you wish to construct for your reader
Follow the format provided by the ""I Am From"" poem template (you will have the opportunity to alter it later if you'd like)

In the final week of each unit, we will have a ""Design Week."" This is a week where you get to... design your Unit Portfolio. If you have kept up with your work all unit, this week will be cake for you. You've already both drafted and revised your documents. Now, you get to utilize your peers and instructor's previous feedback to refine your work, gather additional feedback to ensure that you've put forth your best effort, and begin thinking about how to create a portfolio that accentuates the great things about the work that you've developed over the last several weeks.
As a reminder, your professor, your Lab Instructor, and your classmates are your BEST RESOURCES, so USE THEM! And in using them, make sure to be clear about what, exactly, you need out of that interaction. For that purpose, below is a reminder of Elbow and Belanoff's ""Ways of Responding"" that can help guide you in gathering the best possible feedback for your writing. As a reminder, when you are working with your peers, make sure to always ask ""what type of response do you feel would be most helpful for you, so that I can structure my reading of your piece?"" or to provide direction in the form of letting them know what type of feedback that you would like to receive.

We have already done an annotated bibliography for this class as a way of textual map-building. And yet, there are many other purposes for doing annotated bibliographies, as we've talked about throughout class, and each one of them can be a means of supporting your writing process. One of the ways that we'll be using them is to literally cut and arrange our resources to help determine how best to utilize them, what narrative is emerging from the resources, and what gaps we have in our narrative that need further research. However, before we get to that point I want you all to understand them just a little bit better. For that reason, our reading today is going to focus on annotated bibliographies.

For this research project you will go though:

a Reflection process, including a revision plan.
a Learning process, including creating an annotated bibliography to help you identify gaps in your research and provide a framework upon which it could proceed.
a form of the planning process where you will add your voice back into the process, and create a complete draft of your project. 

Like research, we have to provide some framework for it to exist. And for this, we are going to go with the standard ""academic"" framework for your piece. You can make determinations about the audience for this piece, but I want at least part of your audience to be an academic one. If you believe that a better audience to help you solve your problem would be a popular one, don't worry- there will be time for that piece in your Final Portfolio, as well.
TASK
You will create a minimum four-page research paper that will adhere to the following guidelines:



The writing must seek to introduce, and then provide some at least partial solution to, a problem that you see in your ""home"" that you plan to take an active part in.
The writing must include reference to ""assets"" that this community has, and seek to utilize them within the solution
The writing must include references to ""needs"" that this community has and how they relate to the problem/solution
The writing must demonstrate the ways that you will be involved in implementing this solution. This should be a realistic solution to a problem that you have the capacity to be a part of the change. And you can be a part of solving huge problems, if you can identify your role in solving them.
The writing must demonstrate the ways that research will be an ongoing component of discovering and implementing your solution. See the Action Research and/or Narrative Inquiry videos earlier for guides on what these research processes can look like, and ""The Advocate"" for a model on what this can look like in practice out in the real world.
The writing must include a minimum of four citations in MLA or APA format, following the guidelines below:

A minimum of one scholarly citation such as a journal article, book, or study
A minimum of one CREDIBLE popular citation such as a newspaper article, newscast or some other credible form of collecting and distributing information with the community.
Encouraged inclusion of primary resources such as interviews with community members, direct observations, tweet by a neighbor, Facebook post from a community page or someone directly impacted or working on the problem, etc.





The writing's format must adhere to the following guidelines:



Begin with an Introduction that will inform the reader of what types of information they are about to read, characterizes the community and their assets/needs, etc.
Include a discussion of the problem that identifies the problem itself and how it manifests within the community. This should emerge directly from your research question and include citations that help the reader to understand the problem and its context.
Include a discussion of the solution that identifies the actions the author will take, personally and communally, to help to resolve the problem, how you are involved, and how research can play an ongoing role in the solution.
End with a conclusion that wraps up the big ideas and helps the reader to understand the totality of the writing
Be in MLA or APA format

When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

Form a ""What"" question. This may be provided in the form of the weekly reflection topic, or you may have to create it yourself. Do not write it down in your response-- hold it in your mind. Examples are things like ""what was most valuable for me about this week, in class or something out of class that's related to writing or home?"" or ""What are any themes I'm noticing in class this week?"" or ""What is something that we didn't discuss this week that I wish we had""? Then, answer that question in one or two sentences as the first part of your critical reflection.
Form a ""How"" question that emerges from that original question. You should ask yourself- what ""how"" question am I left with after reading my own words? This is your opportunity to analyze not only what is seen in the way you respond, but what is unseen? What might be left out of this conversation? What might someone who sees this situation entirely differently wonder about your statements? Don't ask the question in your response, just answer it in two or three sentences.
Form a ""Why"" question. This is a moment for you to interrogate your own words. Why did you respond this way? What values do you have that lead you to think this way, and are there other valid sets of values or thoughts that others could have, and why might they value or think differently? Don't ask the question in your response-- just answer it in two or three final sentences.

I know that this can be confusing. I've been wordy here, but that's on purpose. The purpose, here, is to make you think hard. I don't want this to be an easy, throw-away assignment. I want you to have to look inside of yourself and earn your words. I want to offer you a road map toward critical reflection, the process of answering not only the question in front of you, but the unasked questions that lurk behind it. To looking not only at yourself as you are, unexamined and unquestioned, but what alternative versions of yourself might look like in a different set of shoes. Not only looking at the world as it is, but an alternate world that could be and whom that world might benefit that this one does not.If you have questions, I'm more than happy to guide you through this process. Let my responses to your first critical reflections guide you-- I tried to use them to push you forward in your responses.
This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is one-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help you grow, not to turn out a product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth.

Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection

Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
Answer the following questions in your writing. I DO NOT want to see just a bulleted list of responses. This should be in paragraph form, and demonstrate that you're thinking about these things, not just dropping something there to have something written. Questions you MUST answer:



Go back to your Preflection. Tell me, what were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection?
How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations?
What did we do this week that most impacted you?
Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer?
How does this relate to our course objectives (available in the syllabus and just below this text)?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Additional questions to consider this week:



How did our readings work together to paint a picture of language, its role in our culture, what shortcomings our cultural understandings of language might have, and what the consequences of those shortcomings might be?
How does our cultural understanding of language impact you, personally?



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Be 100 - 250 words

You've now reviewed your peers' work, and had them review yours. Hopefully, you've had enough time to complete the Peer Review Sheet and share it with them, and they you. Now, we have to figure out what to do with that feedback to create a more effective, revised piece. What are those ways that you can ""go for the jugular"" in your writing, as our previous reading suggests? 
This reading, from the blog Writing Power, provides some concrete things that you can focus on in your revision process to ensure that your writing continues to develop from smart revisions, rather than the spinning wheel of never-ending, meaningless difference. You want to take the feedback that you've received from your peers and be laser focused on how that feedback can inform substantive and rhetorically sound changes that will help you to more effectively communicate with your chosen audience.
To do that, you can focus on many things. However, the three we are going to focus on here are Audience, Purpose and Organization and/or Focus. When you're reading this piece, keep the feedback that you received from your peer in mind. How can the feedback you received be framed by these ideas? How can you better focus your topic, how can you organize your writing to make it clearer or more powerful, how can your purpose be clearer? And how can you more effectively achieve that purpose for your audience... or, how can you alter or reimagine your audience to better achieve that purpose?

This week, we're focusing on working toward a more ""final"" version of our ""Home That Built Me"" drafts. And one part of that which is exactly 0% fun but also very important for you to understand is citation styles. This is probably my least favorite part of academic writing, and I'd imagine perhaps your as well, but the histories of these citation styles are important in understanding why they have emerged as they have.
It comes from the era of the moveable type. Assigning credits in academic work was always something people were concerned about, and for a while it was typically done in a wide variety of ways, in pen, sort of on the fly. ""Narrative"" citations were the norm for the most part, having to include all the information you were trying to cite within your writing itself. This practice goes back to our first ever known linguist, Panini, who we also know was not the first linguist because he cited the work of others before him whose work we do not have records for. However, in 1891 Chicago University recognized that, in order for them to properly file and then search for the work of scholars within their filing systems, some sort of uniformity was necessary. So, they created the first ever citation style guide- The Chicago Style Manual- released in 1891.
Each citation style emerged from this original, with updates each few years to keep up with different mediums, new technology, new potential sources of scholarly information, etc. Citation styles, currently, are working to straddle the line between recognizing that most writing now is housed in digital formats (which could, conceivably, be cited much more effectively through a simple hyperlink) and recognizing that there are still print-only sources and print-only journals where scholars need to be able to credit their influences.
Citation styles also have different priorities based on the disciplines in which they are predominantly used. APA, for instance, is used most commonly in Psychology and other Health and Biological Sciences. Because of the way the scientific method works, we are constantly discovering new information, clarifying and debunking old ideas, etc. For this reason, the year of the publication is very important, and therefore goes alongside the author(s) in the in-text citation and near the front of a citation in the references section at the end of the document. It was also historically organized in file cabinets, and may need to be accessed quickly for assistance in diagnosing or treating patients in a clinical setting or during a lab using live animals where timelines are tight- so the running head allowed for quickly thumbing through documents to find the one you needed. MLA, on the other hand, is more often used in literature where the subject of study's age can vary greatly with no impact on the value of the scholarship. This means that the date of the scholarship comes far after the other crucial information such as what publisher or version the scholar is working from, and the page number is most important to note in the in-text citation. 
Knowing the ways these citation styles assign their values and why they are built the way they are is important to understanding why we even do this thing in academia and writing in general. Attribution is important, and guiding your reader to be able to understand the sources you have pulled from and be able to navigate back to them if they need to verify critical information about your use of that source.
So, while citations may be one of the worst parts of writing, it's still something that you do need to know. Not just because academics say so, but because they serve several very specific purposes and are designed by people who know what they're doing, know this history and know the needs of the discipline in order to design the best possible way to record the necessary information.

KC Chan-Brose,Strange Angels Draft 1,5.0,0.005973715651135006,0.10155316606929511,2022-10-07 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
In our lives, there are times where we come upon someone for just an instant who has a huge impact on us, and then they disappear never to return. Likely, they don't even know the kind of impact they had on us, and never will. They likely never learned our name, and we never learned theirs. They may never think about us again. But we think about them often.
These people are often called ""Strange Angels,"" or people who, while their time with us was brief, their impact lingers. For this assignment, you will be writing a prose-like poem that tells the story of a strange angel
Contrasting with our Ode, which has a relatively rigid structure, this poem is designed to have a very loose structure much like the prose poems by myself and David Shumate. How do you think this might effect the ways that your reader can navigate the poem? The feelings that it engenders? How can you ensure that this is a prose poem rather than a brief letter or reflection? What structural or linguistic elements do you see in David's and my poetry that make it a poem rather than a short essay?
Beyond that loose mandate, the poem can read like a letter to the person, an internal reflection upon the ways they have changed your life, a piece to your future or present children about the ways small actions can have large effects, or many other things. The primary thing that I want you to focus on is the ways that the prose-like structure effects the readability in contrast to your Ode to an Intersection. 
TASK
Tell your audience the story of a ""Strange Angel"" from your life in a prose poem using strong nouns and verbs and descriptive language. Your poem should:



Be less than 3/4 of a page of prose poetry
Describe a very brief encounter, preferably one that can be measured in seconds
Focus on someone who you do not know intimately. Your mom is a regular angel, not a strange angel
Speculate on what is happening in their mind, as well as yours
Use vivid description including all five senses

KC Chan-Brose,Ode to an Intersection Draft 1,5.0,0.005973715651135006,0.10155316606929511,2022-10-07 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
In our exploration of the ways rhetorical decisions can have real-world impacts, we are going to begin working with two types of poetry which look to unite these ideas of space, description and structure. One of these genres is the Ode. Throughout the ages, poets have written odes to things of beauty. ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" by John Keats is one of the most famous, as is ""Ode to the West Wind"" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Odes can take many different forms, but share some qualities.

They speak directly to the subject of the poem, often something unable to speak or even understand, as a way to tell others of its greatness and communicate something larger about the world
They are line poems that incorporate regular line breaks
They are medium-long. These are not ten-line poems, but they're not T.S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" either.

While the language of the poets I've shared odes from above, from the middle of the 19th Century Romantic period, is very flowery and obtuse, I'd like you to write your ode in plain Englishes- whatever Englishes you expect that your chosen intersection would like to hear in an ode to itself. I know that my intersection- where the quiet entrance to my neighborhood exits onto the busiest road in my whole town- wouldn't want me to talk in some kind of academic-speak. It would feel talked down to, and it doesn't deserve that- also, it might just beat me up because as it looks now it's pretty neat, but it's definitely got a rough past. Instead I'd prolly have to talk like the people around it to avoid Discourse Tension and consequences that could damage our relationship.
TASK
Compose an Ode to an Intersection- and yes, I mean that literally. This ode should be dedicated to a literal intersection. Your ode should:



Be dedicated to a literal intersection
Be a minimum of one page
Be a line poem with regular line breaks
Include significant sensory description from all five senses

Seeks some type of larger conversation beyond simply appreciating this intersection

For this end-of-unit reflection, we'll be doing the same exercise that we do every week. There are only 3 differences:

This reflection will be over the entire unit rather than a single week
This reflection will be a bit longer- about twice as long
A cleaned-up version of this reflection (modified to act as a bookend to your Artist's Statement) will appear at the very end of your Portfolio. 

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the last few weeks. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers. 
TASK
READ



University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection

Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
In paragraph form and in a minimum of 250 words, write a cohesive reflection on your work in this unit. Your reflective writing is an opportunity to look back at what we did in class during this unit, remind yourself of what happened, and then think more deeply about what we did, how it's meant to help you develop greater agency over your writing, and why these things might be important for you not just to pass your ENG 101/L01, not just to help you write in your other classes, but as a person hoping to make a difference in the world and leave it a better place through the guidance of the Franciscan Sponsorship Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and Reconciliation.
I should see you actively thinking and considering these things on the page. This is your fifth reflection this semester, so you've now had a bit of practice and gotten some feedback. Since this reflection is meant to be longer, it is also meant to reflect more deeply on the impact of the entire unit and how all of the pieces fit together. 
Questions you MUST respond to in this reflection:



Go back to your Class Preflection. Tell me, what were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection?
How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations?
What did we do this unit that most impacted you? Take a look back at the Canvas for this unit to help guide you in answering this question. Remember, this unit focused on:


 specificity in multiple forms: semantic (choosing words at the right ""level"" of specificity), historic (choosing language that emerges from a history that your audience will either share or appreciate) and communal (choosing language emerging from specific communities to which your audience belongs or will appreciate).

Descriptive linguistics: The idea that all languages are equally able to create meaning and that one version of English or other language is not somehow better than another. This is contrary to what Dr. Vershawn Ashanti Young calls ""dominant language ideology"" (111). We drew connections to the ways we really use language in the world (descriptive linguistics stance) rather than the way that our culture, and especially people who speak the dominant English (standard academic English or ""Broadcast English""), tells us it works (prescriptive linguistic stance).

Revision: You were also either introduced to or reminded of how revision can work to help you cultivate this specificity and make substantive and calculated transformations in your writing.


Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer? Be specific.
How does this relate to our course objectives (available in the syllabus and just below this text)?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Additional questions to consider this week:



How did the progression of our readings in this Unit work together? What story do you believe these readings and class lesson plans were trying to tell? Was it effective? Why/why not?
How did our progression of writing assignments in this Unit work together? What story do you believe they were trying to tell? Was it effective? Why/why not?
How do these ideas we've grappled with in this unit impact the ways you might interact with your peers and their writing?



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Be at least 250 words

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the most effective possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task:

Include all of the things I ask from you
Showcasing each individual piece
Feel like a single, cohesive piece of art

You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
***IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are going to complete your portfolio on Google Docs, Word Online, or another online platform, make sure that I am granted access when you turn in the portfolio. If I can't grade your portfolio, I'll have to count it as either a late submission or as a 0, and neither of us want that***
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:
First: An Artist's Statement of at least 100 words (see link for help in creating artist's statement). An artist statement should:

Be in paragraph form
Introduce your perspective as the artist- who are you? What is your story? How does your identity/story relate to your art?
Let me know who your audience is for your art
Let me know what/who influenced your art
Develop some type of theme for your art
Let me know what I should be looking for in your art
Let me know what you hope your art accomplishes for your audience
Let me know why I should care about your art

Last: A 250-word reflective synopsis of what you've learned in this unit, including quotations and examples from your texts as demonstrations of that learning (for instance a quote from an original version followed by how that section ended up). This can and should be built from your Unit 1 Reflection. It should do the following:

Be in paragraph form
Let me know what your expectations were for this unit and how they were upheld/undermined. This should be directly quoted from your Class Preflection.

Pick up the theme from the Artist's Statement
How have you grown in your identity as a writer during this unit (or not)?

Where, in your writing, can I see your development as a writer as compared to your first drafts or the types of writing you might have done before this class? Quote them directly from your texts to show me this contrast, then let me know which focuses for this unit and/or course outcomes this learning relates to.
Imagine and describe a situation that might occur later in the course where you can apply this learning, and how. 
Imagine and describe a situation that might occur later outside of formal education where you can apply this learning, and how.
Reflect on why this learning is so critical for you, not only as a writer but beyond your identity as a writer in some way.


At any place between these two pieces- wherever it fits best, you should include:

Optional: Your Visual Identity Project
A version of your ""I Am From..."" poem
A version of your ""My Page 1"" .
A finalized version of your ""The Home That Built Me""

GRADING CRITERIA
Your portfolio will be graded using the rubric included in this assignment.

Our classroom, as we talked about on day 1, is a community. Communities are funny things, in that they are amorphous, and often ill-defined by things beyond the feeling that, yeah, this is a community. But they do have a few things in common, and the predominant thing that all communities share is that the people within them are aware that they are part of a community that shares some form of identity and connection, and some form of shared experiences. This project will seek to give you ALL of those things, including overcoming challenges together. Because you all are going to be undergoing the process of bringing your personal visual identity into the collective identity of the classroom.
TASK
The HOW is up to you. But WHAT I want you all to do is combine the photos from your individual virtual identity projects to make some type of digital representation of your class identity. Then, one representative for our community will write an artist's statement from the class to help the viewer understand what the collage is communicating about our community.

As we've been talking about the spaces around us, we've been slowly working toward making the connection back to how these things relate to our language and relationships to learning and writing. Now, these two things are going to slam squarely into each other for this reading, using the concept of discourse/Discourse. As James Paul Gee, the linguist who first described the concept of Discourse, said, if I am to speak in ""perfect"" English as I walk into a predominantly white, male biker bar in West Virginia, I will not only immediately be noticed as out of place but further be immediately unable to effectively navigate this situation. As described earlier, writing is a tool that allows us to more effectively navigate situations (in writing often called contexts, and while Gee and then Madjidji here will be predominantly referring to speaking in these writings, these things also apply in different ways to writing). So, if my language has made it more difficult for me to navigate this situation, how could it possibly be described as ""perfect""?
But it goes deeper. Let's say that I am very familiar with the speech patterns of predominantly white male bikers in this portion of West Virginia, and as I walk in I speak the language of the moment absolutely perfectly. But, I'm wearing a three piece suit and wiping my mouth with a red, silk handkerchief. 
Clearly, communication is not just about the linguistic patterns used. And that's what this piece (written by an undergraduate student from University of Pittsburg, no less) will delve into. But more importantly, it will delve further than that- into the ways that these Discourse patterns can have distinct and noticeable impact upon the ways that we can more or less effectively navigate the world, in which spaces and situations we feel comfortable, etc.
When you read this piece, reflect upon yourself. In what spaces do you feel most comfortable, and how do you think that the relationship between your primary or ""home"" Discourse(s) and the Discourse of other spaces where you feel less comfortable might impact those feelings and your ability to effectively navigate within those spaces?

As we've been talking about the spaces around us, we've been slowly working toward making the connection back to how these things relate to our language and relationships to learning and writing. Now, these two things are going to slam squarely into each other for this reading.
You may have heard in the past people talk about what it means to speak ""Correctly."" Well, I'm here to tell you that, unfortunately, they're usually flat out wrong. In fact, they probably don't speak what they view as ""correctly"" themselves! Even teachers, it turns out, who harp on ""correctness"" are often simply responding to various pet peeves that they have rather than anything supported by actual linguistic research. Their perceptions about what is ""correct"" aren't informed by this research. So... what are they informed by?
Clearly, communication is not just about the linguistic patterns used. There are lots and lots of things that language is about, though. And that's what this piece will delve into. But more importantly, it will reframe what you may have set in mind that are ""Bad Ideas About Writing"" into good ideas about writing.
When you read this piece, reflect upon yourself. In what spaces do you feel most comfortable, and how do you think that the relationship between your primary or ""home"" Discourse(s) and the Discourse of other spaces where you feel less comfortable might impact those feelings and your ability to effectively navigate within those spaces?

When you think of ""home,"" what do you think of? I'm sure that, for many of us, it is a physical structure and we are pretty dang sure that that's the thing that home means. We even have terms for people who don't have that- homeless. But one theme that you are going to notice in this course is that when things seem obvious, that is exactly the moment that we need to engage our critical questions to further examine that topic, because not many things are as simple as they seem.
One place we will routinely visit to illuminate difficult or seemingly simple topics that are likely much more complex are histories. Histories can provide us glimpses into the world before this concept, and what conditions were brought together to bring this concept into the world. And this is what we will be doing with this first reading. How did the concept of ""home"" come to be?

The first thing to learn, of course, is how exactly one CAN respond to your peers' writing.
Peter Elbow- a towering figure in the field of writing studies- and Pat Belanoff, another very well-known scholar in the field (especially in responding to writers) have summarized some of their academic works in an attempt to provide you with a digestible framework for responding to your peers' writing. In particular when we're dealing with the subject of writing where identity is so interwoven into our subject matter, we need to be sure that we're responding in ways that will be both beneficial and sensitive to our counterpart. That's why at the start of your peer response, you should introduce yourself, and then ask at least these three questions before reading:

What is something you feel is most special about your linguistic identity and the place/space/community that it emerges from?
Invite them to tell you a little bit more
What type of response do you feel would be most helpful for you, so that I can read your writing looking for that type of feedback opportunity?

In addition, we'll do another quick reading from ""Bad Ideas About Writing"" that will combat another myth about writing- ""Strong Writing and Writers Don't Need Revision."" In fact, scholarship in Writing Studies shows that quite the opposite is true! The strongest writers go through the MOST ROBUST revision processes! In fact, while students tend to go through between one and three drafts of their pieces, professional writers (depending on their field/genre) go through, on average, well over 20 drafts! But, as you'll read, these changes in professional writers aren't just ""changes for the sake of change,"" but instead, in the metaphor ""Giovanelli uses regarding professional academic writer Tim Weninger's revision process, ""[aiming] for the jugular in... writing. [Going] after wholesale overhaul of [your] argument and of [your] larger work"" (105). That's why we've slowly built our writing up, piece by piece, into a full draft, and now will be going through at least two (guided) revision processes to take this completed draft into its final form that you'll present in your portfolio. Best of luck on your peer reviews!

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection

Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
Your reflective writing is an opportunity to look back at what we did in class during this week, remind yourself of what happened, and then think more deeply about what we did, how it's meant to help you develop greater agency over your writing, and why these things might be important for you not just to pass your ENG 101/L01, not just to help you write in your other classes, but as a person hoping to make a difference in the world and leave it a better place through the guidance of the Franciscan Sponsorship Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and Reconciliation.
I should see you actively thinking and considering these things on the page. This is our third reflection, so you've now had a bit of practice and gotten some feedback. Your reflection this week should attempt to look more deeply into your learning this week than you have had an opportunity to while it was happening:
Questions you MUST respond to in this reflection:



Go back to your Preflection. Tell me, what were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection?
How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations?
What did we do this week that most impacted you? Take a look back at the Canvas for the week to help guide you in answering this question. Remember, this week focused on not finishing up but concluding our readings/targeted discussions about language and its relation to various social realities and how different racial, ethnic, cultural and community groups relate to it, and then moving into how we can support our peers as writers given these new things we've learned.
Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer? Be specific.
How does this relate to our course objectives (available in the syllabus and just below this text)?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Additional questions to consider this week:



How did our readings work together to paint a picture of language, its role in our culture, what shortcomings our cultural understandings of language might have, and what the consequences of those shortcomings might be?
How does this idea of revision fit in with our previous readings?
How does our cultural understanding of language impact the ways you might interact with your peers and their writing?



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Be 100 - 250 words

We've spent a little bit of time speaking about how Discourse Tension can impact educational relationships and opportunities, and have a fairly minimal example of that happening, but without a whole lot of details. But how, exactly, can that Discourse Tension actually impact the realities of people in the world, and what, exactly, can we do about it? What types of people are effected by this Discourse Tension, and how can it be resolved? These are questions that a PhD in Education with a focus on linguistics and literacy in young children can address, and does in the article we'll be reading today. When reading, I want you to imagine yourself in the shoes of the people that Dr. Purcell-Gates refers to- and not just the two people who are constructed as being ""in the right,"" per se. I want you to also see yourself in the villains of these stories, and think back... have I ever been the villain in these stories? Why are they cast as the villains? What behaviors does Dr. Purcell-Gates use to portray them as such? And what alternative behaviors exist? What social pressures led them to act villainous, and how do those social pressures act in other ways? Have they acted on me?
As a Marian University student, which of the Franciscan Values applies to this situation, and how can we work to embody those values it in our Discourse Relationships?
Discussion and understanding of some of the key arguments in this work will be crucial to being able to effectively participate in next week's reading and discussion, so make sure you've got this down because next week will build off of this!

We've talked about these ideas about language, power, and their relationships to things you may not have expected like identity and community. Then, we've extended that conversation into how these ideas relate to other identifiers like class groups, and even examined some of the concrete ways that certain populations can feel and be effected by cultural ideas of language and their intersection with our various identities.
Now, we're going to look at an additional dimension of this conversation that involves race and its long and tense history in this country and elsewhere. We've sort of skirted alongside this topic a couple of times with our conversation about Jamila Lyiscott's ""Three Ways to Speak English."" Now, we're going to confront it head-on. Lisa Delpit does a really solid job of laying out a (very recent) history of the journey Black English has taken even through the courts while analyzing her personal struggle with what WEB DuBois called ""The Double Consciousness,"" the need to appease predominantly white, middle/upper class Discourses while trying to retain identity. Lee Tonouchi, celebrated author and speaker of the language known as ""Hawaiian Pidgin,"" as well, takes a stand on this issue with his commencement speech to graduates of the University of Hawaii. 
The Franciscan Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and especially Reconciliation can play a big role during our class discussion around this topic (following a very brief lecture by myself to provide some additional context as to why this conversation is necessary). How is linguistic justice directly related to racial justice? To economic justice? To justice of space and place (we'll explore this more later!)? And, most of all, what does it look like to live in a world with linguistic justice that lives out these Franciscan Values?

Note: Writing for this piece should be in the language that you speak with your friends and family from these ""home"" locations.
Writing, as we've mentioned many times before, is a process, and one that will come alongside and even lead to learning new things. Your Exploratory draft of your ""The Home That Built Me"" essay emerged from your ""I Am From"" and ""My Page 1"" to create a highly specific focus around your linguistic identity and its  relationship to the other ways you relate to the world. You focused around providing examples of, describing and analyzing your own speech and how it relates to your identity and community. You began to draw from our class readings that speak to how the multiple Englishes, the co-equal versions of English spoken throughout the world, can and do relate to things that perhaps you may never have thought of before like social power, histories, places, race, ethnicity, class, and more, and their unequal impacts on the speakers of those Englishes despite linguists' constant refrain that they are, in fact, equal.
Now, you're going to build on that exploratory draft, incorporating new knowledge from our class readings and discussions, to continue building toward a piece you are proud to have built.
Below, find the requirements for the Final version of ""The Home That Built Me"" which will be due at the end of Week 5. Your Draft 2 is meant to be an attempt at this final version, which I and your classmates will provide feedback on to help you develop Draft 2 in to the final version which will appear in your Unit 1 Portfolio.
Make sure to read this prompt closely and completely. Think about how the design of the Exploratory Draft moved you closer and closer to a version of this assignment that fulfills these requirements. And think about, as you're drafting, how these requirements are guiding you toward thinking critically about your own language, identity, and its place within the world. 
TASK
Your Final Draft (and, of course, Draft 2 as it works toward this final) should: 
PROCESS REQUIREMENTS FOR DRAFT 2 ONLY

Demonstrate significant revision from your Exploratory Draft based on the feedback received from your instructor, peers, Lab Instructor and Writing Center visit(s). Drafts showing only minor revisions will not receive credit. 
Demonstrate increased awareness of the social dimensions of language (relationship to power, ethnicity, race, class, community etc.) beyond the Exploratory Draft due to additional readings and class discussions on the subject since the Exploratory Draft. Essentially, that you've been continuing to learn and have incorporated that learning into your writing.
Demonstrate greater focus on appealing to an ideal reader or audience to whom you wish to speak and accomplish your purpose

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR DRAFT 2 AND FINAL
Focus on Language

Your HTBM should be written, at least partially, in an English you would consider your Home Language.
Your HTBM should focus predominantly on your own language, language practices, and linguistic identity- turning over, thinking about, and analyzing those things you may never have thought of before in light of what we've learned in class so far, but always coming back to these factors as your focus.
Your description of your Linguistic Identity should include examples of your Home Language (in quotations) and descriptions of what makes it unique.
Your HTBM should be explicit about what you find valuable about your Home Language
Your HTBM should be explicit about whether these things you value about your home language appear, in your mind, to be shared by our wider culture and academia
In describing your linguistic identity etc., what makes it unique and valuable to you, and whether it is seen in the same light by others in the wider culture/academia, you should support your ideas with a minimum of one class resource cited in MLA format
 

Connections Between Language and Sociocultural Factors


Your HTBM should spend time on what factors we've talked about that relate to language (relationship to power, ethnicity, race, class, community etc.) are most salient in your Home Language and Linguistic Identity.
Your Home Language should be connected to other factors that influence what someone might notice is unique about your linguistic community such as how people talk with their bodies, how people wear their clothes, what values are shared among people in the community, where you come from- in other words, the ""distinctive ways of using discourse, that is, speaking/listening and/or reading/writing coupled with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing"" (Gee, 2011).
Tell your reader about a time your Home Language ever brought you into conflict with someone else, or been a factor in a misunderstanding? Describe what occurred and how some of the factors we've talked about in class relating to Discourse (the ""distinctive ways of using discourse, that is, speaking/listening and/or reading/writing coupled with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing"" (Gee, 2011)) were part of the reason this conflict or misunderstanding occurred.
Do you feel as if you have to ""code switch"" in order to not be perceived negatively in certain places? Where do you do this, and why? If you don't have to do this, as I don't really have to, why is that the case?
What does living the Franciscan Values of Peace and Justice, Dignity of the Individual, Responsible Stewardship and Reconciliation look like for our society regarding language and linguistic identity look like to you?
Your concept of Linguistic Identity, Home Language and its relationship to these sociocultural factors we've discussed in class should be supported by a minimum of one class resource cited in MLA format

Connections to Your Identity As a Writer

Your HTBM should think about how your linguistic identity and all these other factors relate to how you have experienced language in school, in other communities, etc. using concrete examples you describe using the types of specificity we've discussed in this unit- both word-level and historically-rooted.
Your HTBM should connect these experiences to whether or not you identify as a writer
Your HTBM should imagine an alternate world where you think differently about writing. What factors (such as the sociocultural factors we've talked about in class) could have changed the ways you think about writing? If your Home Language were supported in the classroom? If you'd thought of writing as fulfilling some real purpose, rather than a 5-paragraph essay for a standardized test assessment? What factors we've talked about in this class might have led to this change?
Has your concept of your writerly identity changed during this class?
In connecting to your identity as a writer, you should back up these ideas with a minimum of one class resource cited in MLA format. 

Formatting and Style Requirements

Your HTBM should be written, at least partially, in the English or other language that you consider your Home Language
All citations in your HTBM should have an in-text component and a corresponding citation in your Works Cited in MLA/APA format on a new page at the end of your document.`
Your HTBM must be at least 4 pages, double-spaced, Times New Roman 12 pt. font- not including your Works Cited page

KC Chan-Brose,CLASS READINGS 9/26,,0,0,,"PURPOSE
Every text, whether it is delivered in an image, a chart, a memo, an article or a meme includes author(s) who are making intentional (though perhaps not conscious) choices about what to include. And while these choices, at times, may seem random or arbitrary, they are not. The fields that we have ventured into in this class- those of sociolinguistics, rhetorics, and writing studies, all are very aware that these choices are the result of the choices that have been made in the past, linked to events stretching back and back and back- especially those events that feel ""normal"" or ""natural."" Their normal-ness and natural-ness is born of recurrence, until those choices seem to be the only ones a writer can make. 
But as a class of individuals looking at these choices in an informed and conscious manner, we know different. There are always other choices that can be made, and there are always people already making those choices. Often, those choices are not the ones we (if we're in the group that sees ""normalness"" in what is often called the ""dominant"" perspective) can see without actively seeking them out.
In these readings, we're going to take a look at one of the formats that is often seen as the most normal and natural- a map. How, do you ask, could a map hide anything? It's literally their job to show us things! Or... is it? As we are looking at these maps and looking at the hidden, silenced or alternative perspectives available to us through the use of Critical Questions like ""who gets to speak/is left out?"" ""which perspectives are offered/silenced?"" and ""Who benefits?"" we will often see beneath the surface level and find out that what communications intend and what they do can be radically different. So what, exactly, do the maps you'll see below really do?

First, answer the four questions below:



How is this reading/thinking similar to or different to work that I've been asked to do in the past either in school or outside of it?'
What do I see available for me to learn in this lesson? 
How can seeking to look at something a different way help me in this course, in my university experience, and beyond it? 
What do each of these maps or readings intend to communicate, and what do they communicate? 



Then, craft three questions that you still have about maps, including what they might communicate that is unintended or unseen.

KC Chan-Brose,CLASS READINGS 9/28,,0,0,,"PURPOSE
When we think of maps and places, we often think about these things as neutral and ahistorical. They are what they are, and that's what they are. When we go to the Yats on Indiana Avenue, there is no history dripping from the walls. We don't see the ghosts of the past immediately on the surface. Things seem as if they have always been and always will be.
But if we think about this for more than just a moment, we know that this is not true. History DOES drip from the walls- just invisibly in the ways that we reckon with the present. Yats would not be there if it weren't for IUPUI. And IUPUI would not be there without a very particular word, ""blight."" And that word would not have existed without segregation, and Indiana's role as a hub of the Klan in the 1910's, 20's and even 30's. And segregation would not have existed without the Union victory in the civil war (and the KKK's victories in the subsequent terrorist-ruled south) that led to a great migration of Black men and women from the South into Indianapolis. And there never would've even been an Indianapolis if it hadn't been for settlers breaking the Royal Proclamation of 1763.
Just as important, not all histories are created equal in that not all histories are readily told. Some histories are readily available to us, like the Crispus Attucks wins in Indiana State Basketball memorialized downtown at the IHSAA Hall of Fame. Far less told is what happened afterward- when the team's victory parade- a parade that had happened every year for the winner of the championship for decades- was rerouted away from downtown due to the perception that Black fans would be violent. This happened again in 1956 after winning their second straight title- after which basketball star Oscar Robertson simply went home rather than face what he deemed a humiliating ""second-class celebration."" Fun fact- you may also know a little bit about the team that won the year before in 1954- the Milan High School Indians, the team memorialized in the movie Hoosiers and the team Hollywood made the intentional choice to immortalize on the silver screen despite essentially making up the whole thing beside the fact that they won a state title. 
For this reading, we're going to investigate the ways that histories continue to live today in the stories that we tell about places and spaces, and the very real lived experiences of people who inhabit those spaces. I want you to look for ways that our ideas of Discourse Tensions could overlap the maps and articles that we will be reading, and think through what Peace and Justice might mean given what we are learning.

While we have been looking at maps, we've been talking about some of the rhetorical choices that go into map design and how those decisions effect the not intended, but real function of those maps and how they can actively effect the lives of others. This, of course, is not only true of maps. Not all writing effects lives in the same ways, and poetry probably doesn't have the same tangible consequences upon our lives as mapping, but one of the key facts about writing is that it does effect you in some way.
One of those rhetorical decisions we've been focusing on is the structure of those pieces. How are the elements organized so as to communicate with and effect the reader? In the following pieces, I want you to focus on that structure. What does the structure communicate between these pieces? How are they different, and what effect does that have upon the way it effects you? Most important, how can you make intentional rhetorical decisions about structure in order to facilitate a certain effect?

KC Chan-Brose,Week 7 Overview: The Structures That Build Us,0.0,0,0,,"PURPOSE
Last week, we spent time looking at writing structures and the ways they can actually serve to craft ideas of physical space and, therefore, even our physical space itself. This week, we'll be taking that lesson forward into our writing in a bit more subtle ways. For instance, how can we utilize a typically-boring structural element- the works cited- to help enrich the textual/hypertextual world of our writing? What purposes can this type of structure serve, and which purposes do I want it to serve? And how can structure in writing serve as a meaning-making tool, to help craft my understandings of a piece of writing?
We'll seek out the ways that structure can almost literally transport your reader from one place to another, and even think about the ways that changing the organization of your work- one of the elements of structure- can change the possible meaning that can be gleaned from it. Then, we'll get to work creating a piece that is most likely a radical structural departure from any work that you've ever done before- our ""Re-Mix Essay.""

Let me tell you a secret. I hate formatting. I hate it. I run a writing center on campus, and hate it. And yet, it's something that I don't save to the end of a project like a lot of things that I hate to do like painting my shed (still need to do that) or trimming when I mow. I do it right at the beginning, because I've recognized something about formatting. When done in a particular way with an eye toward its utility, it can be incredibly useful.
First off, formatting hasn't, historically, been meant for writers. Instead, it's been meant for readers. An in-text citation, footnote or works cited are what are called hypertextual elements-- ways that you can guide your readers beyond your text to supplement your own argumentation and provide substantiation through the work of others. In our use of these formatting styles, it can also transport readers spatially to places we want them to see and experience through media beyond the orthographic text. You see, formatting, used purposefully and with an eye on the message you are crafting and how your audiences are likely to navigate your work can create a far richer, more captivating and potentially more persuasive experience for your reader, bolstering the effectiveness of your writing without having to write a single additional word.
Second, an annotated bibliography can be a great window into asking yourself who you are allowing time to speak in your writing. If, for instance, you were writing a history of the American Revolution and, looking through your notes, you see British political voices, American political voices, and French political voices, you could ask yourself ""who else had a role and stake in the American Revolution who I haven't included?"" The answers might include the hundreds of thousands of people living on the continent who did not belong to those groups, but definitely had a role in the conflict such as the various Algonquin nations (Iroquois being a prominent member), Black people who were enslaved on the continent or Black freedmen, women who were shut out of the political process, poorer white men who did not have the platform of a political position, other groups who today we consider ""white"" who at the time would not have been considered as such, etc. And perhaps you may have never even noticed these omissions if you hadn't seen all of your citations in one place.
Third, there are lots of programs that can help you with formatting- if you commit to them from the get-go. We're in the age of automation, and formatting hasn't been exempted from that. There are lots of really, really bad ones (PLEASE don't use easybib or online software like that. It gets things wrong more than right), but there are some really, really good ones as well like Mendeley, EndNote and Academic Writer (for APA, the program in which I wrote my thesis). And these programs not only tackle formatting for you, but they can automatically create and format in-text and bibliographic citations, help you to chain research, offer similar articles via in-program suggestion or even on a regular basis via email if you have a research area you are really interested in, and guide you through the process of crafting a paper in a certain formatting style in ways that become worry-free.
It's with these two things in mind- the ways that we can use formatting to craft a more valuable reader experience and the ways that beginning in an effective environment can craft a more valuable writer experience- that we enter this next phase of our writing journey in this class. I don't want you to think of formatting, like I did as a college freshman, as that tedious thing that I have to do so my teachers don't steal points from me. I want you to think about it as a dynamic method of engaging in an inquiry process that will lead to a richer experience for your reader.

So far, we have looked at structure and the ways it acts relatively directly to influence readers. However, structure doesn't have to be such a bang-you-on-the-head phenomenon. Structure can work in much more subtle ways, as well. And while we've practiced those subtle-yet-harsh methods of structure in our Class Map, we'll be exploring other ways that structure impacts the effect your writing can have through these next few pieces.
We've had a discussion about these readings before, but I want us to revisit in light of our last full week of discussions over structure. What new things do you see in these poems after learning about structure for the previous week? How do these new things that you're seeing impact your reading of the poetry? How can they impact the ways that you can go about structuring your writing?
 
As you are reading, ask yourself what elements of structure are you seeing from the list below:



Macro-structure (alignments, fonts, page colors- ""whole-page"" or ""whole-document"" structural elements)
Paragraph-level structure (line breaks, ""white space,"" the ways sentences fit together)
Sentence structure (long or short, run-ons or fragments, grammatical choice, use of larger/smaller words, alliteration, etc.)
Micro-structure (below sentence level such as spelling choices, grammar choices, punctuation choices etc.)

Particularly useful, here, are the concrete ways the author provides to think about re-envisioning: 



Re-envisioning your writing's focus
Re-envisioning your writing's organization (one of the elements of structure we've been talking about)
Re-envisioning your writing's audience (he pairs this one with another element I've separated out below)

Annotated Bibliographies can serve many purposes. They can be a guide for ongoing research. They can be a roadmap, acting as something of a journal of readings and your understandings of them and how they fit into a larger discussion that you can look back on as you move through a learning/writing process. They can serve as an indicator to your instructor as to where your thoughts are on a subject. They can even be a took for you to see what perspectives you have or have not included in your writing. And, as they are often used in college courses, they can serve to provide an indication as to your understanding of materials/formatting styles. 
However, in this course it will be doing something else beyond that. Our annotated bibliography will actually be an integral part of your reader experience, taking them on a hypertextual journey from one space to another, utilizing a form of writing technology to show your reader information they could not encounter with just orthography and then augmenting that with a paragraph briefly summarizing that resource, and then about the ways this experience relates to the ways you might utilize it in writing. In this annotated bibliography, your reader may find themselves moving from your favorite park in your home town to a scholarly reading on the power of language to create in-groups to an infographic about demographics in your home town to a meme about language use in your community- all of which will help to build a fuller understanding of the reality you'd like to construct for your audience and the stories you'd like to tell them.
Our annotated bibliography will follow us through this course from this point on, so make sure you save a copy to turn in here, as well as a copy to continue adding onto. I want you to think about the ways that these various sources can develop your stories and demonstrate that, rather than thinking of this as a single assignment.
I highly encourage the use of mla.org's style guide for this assignment, as well as software designed to assist in these types of projects such as Mendeley or Endnote. Do not use easybib or another online citation generator. There are levels to these types of programs- their algorithms can be more or less accurate, and most of the common ones are quite literally wrong more than they're right.
TASK
Your annotated bib should:



Contain at least three google earth citations for locations you have referenced in your writing
Contain citations for each of your photos shared in your Visual Identity Project

As we have been discussing structure the last couple of weeks, we've talked about physical structure of the world and how it can be ""mapped"" by different rhetorical choices. We've talked about the ways that structure can communicate meaning within our writing, and different manners of using structure to develop our writing. Now, we're going to take the next step, and create a structure of writing you've probably never used before, and we're going to focus not just partly, but ENTIRELY on structure to do it.
A Braided Essay is often a term used to describe the type of essay that we're going to be writing. It is a type of writing that takes at least three different narratives, often told in different genres, and weaves them together- alternately telling one, then the other, then the other. And when these narratives are told together, they make up a brand new narrative. Some of my favorite writing that I've done in the past is similar to the braided essay (though I have often kept it to weaving two stories narratives together rather than three), and some favorite cinematic fiction takes on this form, such as Love Actually or even Avengers use braided or parallel narratives. In fact, the entire MCU could be seen as one big braided essay, weaving together multiple stories to build a larger narrative arc. One of the most important factors- if not the most important factor- in these essays is how they are structured and not how each of these narratives are told, but when and in which chunks and ordering.
TASK
You are going to compose a ""Re-Mix"" of your work this semester so far, meaning you're going to take the work that you've already done, chop it up and put it back together again to form something new like a DJ sampling beats and hooks to create an entirely new song. 
You won't be doing any new writing for this piece. You may revise, if you would like. But you are not going to be doing any new drafting whatsoever. The entire focus of this project is on structure and how it can be used to create and recreate meaning.
The Re-Mix Essay must:



Be composed of short (1-2 paragraphs max) UNALTERED sections of previously-written texts rearranged to form a new piece
Be a minimum of three pages
Include a minimum of one piece of line poetry
Include a minimum of one piece of prose
Include a minimum of three total pieces

As you have read in the overview for Unit 3, scholarly research can take on a much, much broader arena than you may have previously thought. You don't have to be a Stuffy Academic TM in a White Lab Coat TM to do research- research can help you in whatever field that you choose to go into, and can even help you in non-professional settings. 
Let's take a quick look at a couple ways of looking at research that could be useful to you if you're going into fields where you won't be that Stuffy Academic TM.

We've been talking about research in class, but for you to really understand the ways that research can impact daily life, we need to see it. The Advocate, on its face, is a story about a man who gave up a life in academia to take up a life of action- of putting his lack of money where his mouth was and following a calling to do more. However, I would argue that Maurice Young actually never gave up academia. He just took it to its true potential. He never gave up research, he just brought it Home.
As we are rethinking research, I want you to do two things: First, I want you to think about what Maurice is doing and how research is an element of his work. What aspects of his advocacy (the action phase) would be impossible without first digging in, finding out, and learning? What parts of this movie (the reporting phase) would be impossible without that? Why did he choose this particular type of learning rather than another type? Second, I want you to think about yourself in relation to Maurice's work. How does this relate to where you see yourself and the problems that you see yourself solving for your own Home?

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers. 
TASK
READ



University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection (Links to an external site.)
Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.



Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Keep your reflection 100 - 250 words



OBJECTIVES



Substantiate ideas and statements to accomplish a purpose
Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives
Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion
Respond critically to readings and writers

KC Chan-Brose,Online Class Activity: 10/26,5.0,0.005973715651135006,0.10155316606929511,2022-10-26 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As you've now learned through the Action Research viewing, in a research process there is ""reflection,"" then ""learning,"" then ""planning,"" then ""action"" and finally ""reflection"" again. These stages don't have to happen exactly in order, and undergo what's called a recursive or continually overlapping back over each other process... just like all writing processes!
One thing that often gets lost in several of the steps, however, is one of the most crucial aspects of doing effective research that can make a difference. Often, when researching, we become obsessed with a problem. That is, after all, what we're trying to solve. Why wouldn't we focus on that? However, one of the most important steps to solving a problem is identifying what you can do to solve it. And you can't solve a problem without certain tools, resources, people, institutions, etc. How would you solve homelessness without homes? Hunger without food? 
So for this reading, we're going to focus not on our problems, but on assets. There will be a video on something called asset mapping that will give you some perspective on what types of assets you should think of and if you take Action Research out into the world with you (which I encourage you to do, as it is a powerful problem-solving tool) ways to uncover those assets that might otherwise be invisible from your perspective but obvious from others' perspective. You'll then see an example of an asset-based organization doing great work in Indianapolis, the Kheprw Institute. Identify ways that they are identifying and utilizing assets to solve problems in Indianapolis. How can you use what they do as a model for solving the problems you want to solve in your own community?
Don't forget to think about assets as much as, if not more than, your problem when you are in your learning phase of research, and identify those assets in your writing to demonstrate to your reader that your solution is realistic!
TASK
WATCH



The Kheprw Story
Asset Mapping: What Is It?



WRITE



A 100-word reflection that answers the following: 

Are the things you're learning similar to anything that you've seen before? how, or why not?
What community do you identify as ""home"" and what assets are present there? List them out.
Apply our critical questions- who benefits from the assets that you have listed? Who loses out? What patterns of thought are present in this asset base within your community? Which are ignored? 
How can these assets be leveraged in any solutions you might propose? 



OBJECTIVES

KC Chan-Brose,Annotated Bibliography/Draft 1 of Research,5.0,0.005973715651135006,0.10155316606929511,2022-10-31 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As we learned in Unit 2, Annotated Bibliographies can serve many purposes. This time, they will be a way for you to allow the voices of others to help guide your writing. We are, for the first time in this course, expected to allow the voices of others to assist in a very real way in developing our thoughts and our arguments, and an annotated bibliography is one of the best ways for us to do that because it allows you to see your interpretation of those ideas in something like paragraph form in front of you. Therefore, the ""first draft"" of your research project will be in annotated bibliography form (MLA).
This particular annotated bibliography does not have to, and should not, be in alphabetical order. It is a way for you to design your research, so keeping them in alphabetical order like some annotated bibs ask you to do doesn't make all that much sense. I would encourage you to not forget our mapping metaphors that we've been talking about in the annotated bibliography for Unit 2. Though we are foregrounding others' words rather than physical places, that concept still applies. Think about where you are beginning- what does your audience need to know before you introduce the assets/problems? How can you take them from that introduction to the solution, and help them imagine a world where that solution is implemented? Your annotated bibliography can be seen as sort of Google Maps that takes your reader through a route that ends with them being convinced to get on board with solving this problem your way. And as we go along, we'll do some exercises to help you see that route more clearly, see where you've missed steps in the directions that you need to go back and find, and see where your voice can take the reader through this research.
I highly encourage the use of mla.org's interactive practice template for this assignment, as well as software designed to assist in these types of projects such as Mendeley or Endnote. Do not use easybib or another online citation generator. There are quality levels to these types of programs- their algorithms can be more or less accurate, and most of the common ones are quite literally wrong more than they're right.
TASK
Your annotated bib should:



Be in MLA or APA format
Contain at least three citations
Contain at least one scholarly citation relevant to the problem you want to solve
Contain at least one ""popular"" citation relevant to the problem that you want to solve
Be in an order that you believe will be effective in creating an argument for your reader



Your annotations should:



Immediately follow the appropriate citation
Summarize the primary information contained in the source
Evaluates the relevancy and credibility of the source
Provide a brief interpretation of how this source will function within your research project

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the best possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task- include all of the things I ask from you, and while showcasing each individual piece, also feel like a single, cohesive piece of art. You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:

At the front of the portfolio, an Artist's Statement of at least 100 words
At the end, a reflection of at least 100 words (can be very similar to your end of unit reflection)

At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Ode to an Intersection""
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Strange Angels""
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Re-Mix""



GRADING CRITERIA
Your portfolio will be graded using this rubric 
RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES



Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing

KC Chan-Brose,CLASS READING 4/11 and Revision Plan,5.0,0.005973715651135006,0.10155316606929511,2022-04-11 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
You have now created a draft of your research paper. And, as we've discussed before in this class, writing is not simply the act of putting something down on paper... that's drafting. Writing is just as much, if not more, reading your own work with a critical eye, getting the input of others, and revising and re-envisioning that work with a keener eye on your purpose and audience, as well as the myriad ways you can achieve that purpose for that audience. 
However, as novice writers you are likely not all that familiar with that process. While professional writers spend up to 90% of their time in the revision stage, novice writers tend to only go through 1 or 2 drafts. So, one of the things that we are going to do is help you to create a revision plan, or a template for how you can undergo the revision process as you move forward. 
The revision plan template is very simple, and it may look very familiar to you. It is similar, of course, to the Peer Review form that you've completed each time we've been moving into the Portfolio phase of a unit. That's because I'd like to direct your eye to some of those same places-- not to things like punctuation and nit-picky little things, but how effectively am I bringing an idea to an audience that I understand with a chance to move them toward some action. What is that idea, and how can I sharpen it? Who is that audience, and how can I understand and speak to them in a way they will value? What is my purpose, and how can I move my audience toward it?
These are the questions of revision, and they bring in some of our big ideas from the rest of this semester:

Language varieties/Discourses
Structures
and, especially, Rhetorical Choices

KC Chan-Brose,Week 11 Overview,0.0,0,0,2022-11-02 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Unit 3, as you may have noticed, is entirely dedicated to two things: 

Helping you to revise your idea of ""research"" and figure out a way to incorporate it into how you can make sense of the world
Helping you to revise your idea of ""revision"" and figure out a way to incorporate it into how you can make sense of the world

But there is a third thing that we have sort of touched upon, but I want to make more explicit now. We have been building toward this all semester, and it's time to bring it out in the open. And that is this:

Reminding you what you've known all along- that you and your words have power. That you and your words matter. That you and your writing can do great things. That research, revision, and writing can be- and are- both a form of and precursor to actions which YOU are capable of. Actions that utilize both your previous knowledge and experience and the knowledge and experience you've gained in this class. Actions that can, if you choose, help to bring about a better world filled with Peace and Justice.

This week we will be basing our discussions and work around these principles and answering these questions for you, personally.
What is ""research"" to you, and how can it be of use to you and the world you want to build? How can the concepts of ""revision"" we've been talking through this semester help you to achieve those goals? And what powers do you and your voice have to help bring about greater Peace and Justice in the world?

This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this unit and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

As we are working on our research writing and discussions of research, I don't want us to lose sight of the work that we've been doing all semester with focusing on really critical things like home and specificity and structure and language choices. For that reason, while we're working on your research project, we will also be beginning to read a novel by Maurice Broaddus with a strong theme of home, especially for characters who are, objectively, very far from the place that they have always called home. 
This reading will be sort of a model text for us. We will look at the ways that Broaddus uses his characters and their relationships to explore these concepts of home, we will see the ways he utilizes specificity, structure and language in this exploration. And we'll see the ways that he employs distinct rhetorical choices to accomplish various purposes within the text, and occasionally take some time to sit back, take a break from the hustle and bustle, and just discuss our reading and how it relates to our discussions of our writing.

For this end-of-unit reflection, we'll be doing the same exercise that we do every week. There are only 3 differences:



This reflection will be over the entire unit rather than a single week
This reflection will be a bit longer- about twice as long
A cleaned-up version of this reflection (modified to act as a bookend to your Artist's Statement) will appear at the very end of your Portfolio. 



As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the last few weeks. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week.

After viewing The Advocate, a story about Maurice Young and his advocacy relationship to the homeless community in Indianapolis, what questions do you have? 
One question I have is... well, did it work?
And, hopefully, that's a question that you are left with, as well. And that's, really where research begins. With a question. And for this assignment, you are going to spend just a little bit of time looking into an answer for that- the ""learning"" portion of research.
TASK
For this assignment, you'll need to do a bit of digging into the current state of homelessness in Indianapolis compared to where it was in 2015 at the release of The Advocate. 
RESEARCH



A minimum of 3 credible sources providing information on the state of homelessness in Indianapolis in 2015 and then any point between then and 2021



WRITE



A 100-word reflection on the methods that you utilized in:

locating your sources
evaluating your sources (were there any you declined to use due to dubiousness?)
synthesizing your sources into a narrative (how did you determine what these resources say together?)
Cite your sources in MLA or APA format

Ksander, Yael. “Unigov.” Indiana Public Media. 11 Jun. 2007, Bloomington, Indiana.
I looked at this piece because I wanted to discover what happened to Maurice Young, but what I found instead was information that could have been a catalyst to why Maurice had to live among the homeless. This article tells me that unigov “resuscitated Indianapolis” but if it had, Maurice Young wouldn’t have to broach the homelessness conversation in indy in 2015 (Ksander).

We have been working through this research assignment for two weeks now, and it has become time for it to take shape. You have been working either in opposition to or directly from a problem that you stated you wished to solve in your Writing Assessment Essay, and have been through a Reflection process, including a revision plan. You have been through a Learning process, including creating an annotated bibliography to help you identify gaps in your research and provide a framework upon which it could proceed. Now, it is time to add your voice back into the process, and create a complete draft of your project, which is a form of the planning process. 
Like all research, we have to provide some framework for it to exist. And for this, we are going to go with the standard ""academic"" framework for your piece. You can make determinations about the audience for this piece, but I want at least part of your audience to be an academic one. If you believe that a better audience to help you solve your problem would be a popular one, don't worry- there will be time for that piece in your Final Portfolio, as well.
TASK
You will create a minimum four-page research paper that will adhere to the following guidelines:



The writing must seek to introduce, and then provide some at least partial solution to, a problem that you see in your ""home.""
The writing must include reference to ""assets"" that this community has, and seek to utilize them within the solution
The writing must include references to ""needs"" that this community has and how they relate to the problem/solution
The writing must demonstrate the ways that you will be involved in implementing this solution. This should be a realistic solution to a problem that you have the capacity to be a part of the change. And you can be a part of solving huge problems, if you can identify your role in solving them.
The writing must demonstrate the ways that research will be an ongoing component discovering and implementing a solution. See the Action Research and/or Narrative Inquiry videos earlier for guides on what these research processes can look like, and ""The Advocate"" for a model on what this can look like in practice.
The writing must include a minimum of four citations in MLA format, following the guidelines below:

A minimum of one scholarly citation such as a journal article, book, or study
A minimum of one CREDIBLE popular citation such as a newspaper article, tweet, or other piece emerging from the community themselves
A possibility for primary resources such as interviews with community members, direct observations, etc.





The writing's format must adhere to the following guidelines:



Begin with an Introduction that will inform the reader of what types of information they are about to read, characterizes the community and their assets/needs, etc.
Include a discussion of the problem that identifies the problem itself and how it manifests within the community. This should include citations that help the reader to understand the problem and its context.
Include a discussion of the solution that identifies the actions the author will take, personally and communally, to help to resolve the problem, how you are involved, and how research can play an ongoing role in the solution.
End with a conclusion that wraps up the big ideas and helps the reader to understand the totality of the writing
Be in MLA format

KC Chan-Brose,Optional Assignment: Writing Center Visit,0.0,0,0,2022-04-14 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
While I know that all of you are in the Writing Lab and receiving regular feedback and conversations about the class and your writing from your Writing Lab Instructor, as we've learned in class, it is equally important to get different feedback and different perspectives. So, as an opportunity for bonus points, you have this assignment to go to the Writing Center for an appointment, and report back on your experience. 
The Writing Center does similar things that your writing lab will. They will get to know you a little bit, ask some critical questions, find the places where your writing shines, and then work with you on any places where you feel that your writing (ideas/concepts, rhetorical choices, word choices, organization, formatting etc.) can continue to grow. The writing center can work with you from the very beginning of a project, such as when you have a prompt coming up and you want to make sure that you understand it, all the way to the end when you need that last pair of eyes on it. The only difference is that in the ""walk-in"" writing center, you will do this with a fellow student rather than an M.A.-weilding instructor.
You may feel that this will be less beneficial- but the research shows that it is not, in fact. It is simply different. Much the way we've talked about how you all have knowledge that is accessible to you that is valuable that may not necessarily be considered so all the time (like fluency in AAVE or Appalachain English or ""Hick"" as some of you have referred to Southern English), that knowledge is indispensable in some situations. You'll find that your peers will have a lot of that type of knowledge because they are also students who are having to navigate very similar contexts to you. That will give the two of you abilities to better problem-solve together, as co-learners, for these assignments. 
So don't expect your tutors to take charge of the appointments. Go in with an idea of what you'd like to accomplish, and then negotiate with them how you want to approach this co-learning moment for the best of your benefit in this writing project.

This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this unit and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

Each of us has, over the course of this semester, developed different strategies that have worked with us for revising our work. We've done it three times now, so you're probably beginning to feel like a couple of things have worked well for you, and maybe a couple of them haven't. Now, it's time to begin putting those strategies into action.
For this reading, you'll be focusing on making sure you recall those revision strategies, our primary foci for the course, and reading through the Revision Plan template that we'll be using to help you brainstorm new and innovative ways to go about revising these pieces you've been working with all semester. 
TASK
READ



William Xinsurr, ""Revision as Re-Envisioning""

Revision Plan template



WRITE
100 word reflection that answers the following questions:



What lessons do these readings tell me about the values of revision in this class?
How will I utilize these readings in the revision tasks that I have ahead of me? 
What do I think will be valuable to me as I continue writing for this class? For other classes? For my writing outside of my university experience?

TASK
I want you to first look backward through each of your previous preflections and reflections, the assignments you've completed, and all of the work you've done so far this semester. This unit, as you know from the introduction, will be different. We'll be taking that work that we've done and then developing it into something that we can be proud of, something that represents all of that work in writing as a Final Portfolio. That means that everything you've learned so far this semester is integral to how you can develop that portfolio.
Then, given what you've seen and how you've seen yourself developing throughout this class as a writer and student and individual within our community of writers, think ahead to this unit. What do you see for yourself in the next four weeks? What types of work that you've learned how to engage in will you utilize most heavily? What actions will you take? What lessons will you implement? Then, dive into the preflection.
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?

KC Chan-Brose,Revision Plan for Portfolio 1 Assignment,10.0,0.011947431302270013,0.20310633213859022,2022-11-30 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As we have emphasized strongly in this class all year, Writing is Revising. Writing is not drafting. Writing is not editing. Scholars have found that professional writers spend around 90% of their time revising.
This can look like a lot of different things, and we have experienced some of them in this class. Feedback from lab instructors, peers in your class or peers in the Writing Center. We have learned about twelve different types of feedback you can ask for. We have learned about revision about helping yourself to ""Re-Envision"" your focus, your organization, or your purpose. We have even created Peer Review Forms and Revision Plans for your documents. And we've talked through other blended revision/drafting techniques like redrafting, venn diagrams, word association, and more. And importantly, we have learned how to utilize Rhetorical Grammar- using ""grammar,"" or the structure by which we form thoughts through writing, in a purposeful manner to communicate in intended ways with an audience, even breaking ""grammatical rules"" in order to fulfill that goal- and multiple Englishes and other languages available to us as resources.
Now is time to put that learning into action to bring your works, which up to this point have been process drafts, into another gear. I know you all have more that you can give. You can rework that My Page 1 into a work of Flash Fiction. You can reconfigure your Home That Built Me into a letter to your mother to let her know how you've grown since the day you first met 18 years ago, and that you'll be okay now that you've left to go off to college. You can reconfigure your ""Re-Mix"" essay to bring that section that you really needed later in the piece to be there and do what it needs to do, and revise sections to more effectively stick to the thematic purpose. And you can reconfigure your research to be, instead of addressed to an academic or ""professional"" audience, addressed directly to the business owners in your community to ask for support in your efforts to build a better community that embodies Peace and Justice. 
TASK
Choose one of your works from Portfolios 1, 2 or 3 that you will be revising for your Final Portfolio, and using this Revision Plan Worksheet, complete a Revision Plan for that assignment. Remember, you will have a little over THREE FULL WEEKS to complete this revision plan, so you should set your goals accordingly. This revision plan should:



Answer each line fully and completely. Short and uninspired answers will not do.
Demonstrate a level of deep thought about each line. ""Everyone benefits and no one loses out"" is not an acceptable answer.
Create a concrete plan of revision. Where will you focus your energy (focus, organization or purpose?), what strategies will you use, and to whom will this piece now speak?



Your revision plan can, if necessary, include an accompanying paragraph with any questions, concerns, or context that you wish to present to your professor.

You can reconfigure your Home That Built Me into a letter to your mother to let her know how you've grown since the day you first met 18 years ago, and that you'll be okay now that you've left to go off to college. You can reconfigure your ""Re-Mix"" essay to bring that section that you really needed later in the piece to be there and do what it needs to do, and revise sections to more effectively stick to the thematic purpose. And you can reconfigure your research to be, instead of addressed to an academic or ""professional"" audience, addressed directly to the business owners in your community to ask for support in your efforts to build a better community that embodies Peace and Justice. 
TASK
Choose one of your works from Portfolios 1, 2 or 3 that you will be revising for your Final Portfolio, and using this Revision Plan Worksheet, complete a Revision Plan for that assignment. Remember, you will have a little over THREE FULL WEEKS to complete this revision plan, so you should set your goals accordingly. This revision plan should:



Answer each line fully and completely. Short and uninspired answers will not do.
Demonstrate a level of deep thought about each line. ""Everyone benefits and no one loses out"" is not an acceptable answer.
Create a concrete plan of revision. Where will you focus your energy (focus, organization or purpose?), what strategies will you use, and to whom will this piece now speak?



Your revision plan can, if necessary, include an accompanying paragraph with any questions, concerns, or context that you wish to present to your professor.
OBJECTIVES



Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives
Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion

As we have emphasized strongly in this class all year, Writing is Revising. Writing is not drafting. Writing is not editing. Scholars have found that professional writers spend around 90% of their time revising.
This can look like a lot of different things, and we have experienced some of them in this class. Feedback from lab instructors, peers in your class or peers in the Writing Center (Links to an external site.). We have learned about twelve different types of feedback you can ask for (Links to an external site.). We have learned about revision about helping yourself to ""Re-Envision"" your focus, your organization, or your purpose (Links to an external site.). We have even created Peer Review Forms and Revision Plans for your documents. And we've talked through other blended revision/drafting techniques like redrafting, venn diagrams, word association, and more. And importantly, we have learned how to utilize Rhetorical Grammar- using ""grammar,"" or the structure by which we form thoughts through writing, in a purposeful manner to communicate in intended ways with an audience, even breaking ""grammatical rules"" in order to fulfill that goal- and multiple Englishes and other languages available to us as resources.
Now is time to put that learning into action to bring your works, which up to this point have been process drafts, into another gear. I know you all have more that you can give. You can rework that My Page 1 into a work of Flash Fiction (Links to an external site.).

One of the best things about a writing class at Marian University is that we prioritize one-on-one interaction with you as writers and as people. In that way, I hope to get to know you as an individual that I can know not only know as a student, but as a person. I hope by some point in this class that we have built a positive relationship that involves trust, understanding and an affinity for exploring the ideas that you love and vibe with through writing. In order to do that, though, I need to meet with you one-on-one rather than in a group of a half-dozen or more. This is the first step in that process.
TASK
You will use this link to schedule this appointment. Make sure to choose my name when you're looking to schedule the time. If the link does not work for you for whatever reason, you should use Microsoft Outlook to schedule a one-on-one meeting with me in my office, Faculty C, in the Mother Theresa Hackelmeier Memorial Library (second floor, right above the writing center). A quick tutorial about how to schedule an online appointment can be found here. Ignore the part about including a TEAMS meeting... we will be meeting in person.
HOW YOU'LL BE GRADED
Once you have scheduled this meeting and screenshot evidence it has been scheduled, I will give you a score of 5 for completion of the assignment. If you do not attend or need to reschedule, I will change the score to 0 until we are able to successfully meet, at which time it will be changed back to a 5."
KC Chan-Brose,DUE 12/13: FINAL PORTFOLIO,200.0,0.23894862604540024,4.062126642771804,2022-12-14 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Like every other portfolio you've turned in in this class, the Final Portfolio is a chance for you to demonstrate the ways that you've applied what we've learned in class to your writing projects. The only difference between this one and your last 3- besides that you've had three times to practice now- is that this portfolio is an opportunity to showcase your work and growth throughout the entire course.
As we've discussed many times in class, the measure of a writer is not how cleanly they can get words down on paper the first try, but the process by which they move from concept to polish. The best writers, in other words, are not those who can vomit most efficiently onto the page, but those who are the most tenacious, stick with it the longest, apply their learning, and come to a final product conscious and confident of its eventual impact on the audience. This portfolio is a chance for you to show that trait in yourself through your writing and its growth.
***
This portfolio's intent is outlined in the course syllabus, and is meant to demonstrate your ability aligning with the following General Education Objectives:
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes;
And Course Outcomes:
a. Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
b. Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
c. Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
d. Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .
***
You have, throughout this unit, been asked to interpret meaning from different information mediums like text, audio, video and image, as well as a range of information presentation types from maps to articles to documentaries. You've been asked to communicate within a range of purposes, from informative research to inquiry to opinion to persuasion, within a wide variety of genres. 
You have been asked to utilize various techniques discussed in class such as showing/telling, naming and structure, as well as a range of evidence strategies from emotional/logical to anecdotal to communal to scholarly. Your audiences have been both academic and non-academic, they have required multiple perspectives and critical inquiry into who benefits/is left out, who gets to speak/is silenced, and what ideologies are present/ignored. And, through your reflective writing and reading strategies we've learned, you've been asked to reflect on how these writings bear upon your ideas of research, language choices, writing, and our ever constant theme of ""home.""
We've been working on this all semester working up to this revision-focused portfolio, and you are now prepared to demonstrate that learning. 
Instructions
In a single document, you will combine the following writing projects

First- An Artist's Statement, designed to prepare your reader for what they will be reading. This should set me up to view the rest of your portfolio through the lens you'd like me to see it. Do you want me to see your growth as a writer? Do you want me to see the way you've really attacked ""naming"" as a strategy? Do you want me to see the contrast between the different types/genres of research writing you've undertaken? Set me up to read it that way not just with your words, but with good writing that utilizes the very strategies we've been talking about all semester from naming to showing vs. telling to meaning-making structure, and even references to the text if that will be helpful. 
Next- In whatever order you deem most appropriate for the way you'd like me to read your Unit 3 Portfolio:

A Unit 1 Section, consisting of: 

Your chosen document from Unit 1 in its original version from Portfolio 1. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 1
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.
A Unit 2 Section, consisting of: 

Your chosen document from Unit 2 in its original version from Portfolio 2. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 2
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.
A Unit 3 Section, consisting of:

Your chosen document from Unit 3 in its original version from Portfolio 3. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 3
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.
A minimum of one additional writing, meant to demonstrate your overall growth through this class, consisting of:

Your chosen document  in its original version from its original portfolio. The original document should have sections that have been altered highlighted for me to easily locate them and compare them to the new, revised version.
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 3
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing, specifically referencing highlighted sections from the original and their corresponding sections in the new, revised version.

 

Last- Your Final Course Reflection. If you need to edit this for submission, you may. It should work as a bookend to your Artist's Statement and build upon the mini-reflections within each section, telling me not what should I expect but what learning did I just witness in these pages? I should leave the final section of your portfolio feeling that I understand not only what growth was demonstrated in your writing, but what growth have you undergone that cannot be seen in texts or you were not able to effectively demonstrate with the texts that you've chosen, and what growth you have undergone as a writer and thinker over the course of this semester. Most importantly, I want to know how you plan to utilize that growth as you move through your collegiate and post-collegiate life, and why that growth is a valuable asset to you now and in the future both as a student and a person living life on this earth.

GRADING CRITERIA
There are 200 total points available for the Final Portfolio. You will be graded based on the rubric attached to this assignment, with primary focus on the Course Objectives/Outcomes and the themes of each unit, as well as the standard process, rhetorical decisions, organization/structure, linguistic choices, how effectively you responded to the prompt, whether your writing demonstrates the Franciscan Values, and whether you've included all of the appropriate pieces required for the portfolio listed above.
HOW TO SUBMIT
There are multiple ways to construct your portfolio, but it should be submitted either as a link to a webpage like Wix or a Word Online doc, or as a file such as a Power Point or Word document. Ensure that you are taking into account how your portfolio will appear visually in whatever format you choose. As we talked about in our unit on Structure, the way your writing presents visually is part of the rhetorical choices you make and one of the ways you create meaning and readability!
One final bit of advice: While you definitely want to let me know which piece in your portfolio is which, creating TITLES are a huge help toward building a full piece of writing! Titles are the first thing a reader sees when they open up your document, and ""Unit 3 Portfolio"" is not nearly as compelling or as effective at providing a reader an effective starting point as ""It's Alive: Research in the Real World through a College Freshman's Eyes"" and ""Homelessness Research Project"" is not as emotionally thwacking as ""When Your City Doesn't Want You"" or ""Solidarity Beneath Davidson Street."""
KC Chan-Brose,Final Reflection,30.0,0.035842293906810034,0.6093189964157706,2022-12-14 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Throughout this course we have worked with the intertwining concepts of ""home"" and ""language,"" sometimes smashed together into this idea of ""Discourse,"" ""Home Language,"" ""Englishes"" or ""Literacies."" We've delved into, ""What is Home?"" before looking into the fraught relationships around language and home, before then bursting out into how we can utilize language and writing as a means of action to remake our home in ways that we hope will benefit that home and the world. Along the way, we've learned about Naming, Show vs. Tell, Structure as a meaning-making act, Research as learning enmeshed with action, and more. We've read from successful writers who live life just a few miles from us (Maurice Broaddus, author of Buffalo Soldier, lives on Indianapolis' east side and works at Ujamaa Bookstore despite a writing career that more than keeps the lights on. Some of you may have met him there!).
Now, I want you to look back on all of those experiences I just summarized- many of which needed to be omitted for the sake of space (remember, what is not there or what is left out are just as important and meaningful as what is put in writing)- and put down in writing the ways that you have changed through this process.
This reflection is an example of Writing to Learn. I don't care if it feels messy or if there are misspellings or things don't exactly seem to pan out. What I do want to see is you thinking deeply through text about the topics we've covered and the actions we've taken in this course and how they relate back to this themes of ""home"" and ""language"" we've been exploring all semester.
TASK
This reflection should be in paragraph form, not as a sequential answer to each question. The What/How/Why questions are designed to get you thinking, not to give you a series of three separate prompts. When you're answering each of these questions, your reflective writing should flow together into a unified paragraph.
You will write a minimum of two full pages, reflecting back on the course content and the themes of ""home"" and ""language."" The reflection will be focused on concrete actions throughout the course, and how those concrete actions have led to learning and growth for you as a writer, thinker, student, and human. The reflection should focus on how your work in this class met the objectives/outcomes for the course, and ask yourself the critical questions that we have been working on throughout this class:
How have I demonstrated, through writing and class discussions, that I've grown in the following course objectives?

Substantiate ideas and statements to accomplish a purpose
Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives

Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion

Respond critically to readings and writers
Uses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes

How have the assignments I've completed challenged me toward these outcomes?

Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences
Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences

Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it
Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .

Who do I/have I let speak, and whom do I/have I silenced? And why did I make those decisions in my writing and classroom discussions?
What perspectives do I/have I allowed to influence me, and what perspectives do I/have I ignored? Why did I make those decisions?
What ideological frames do I/have I allowed space in my understanding of the world, and which do I/have I ignored? Why did I make those decisions?

Things you can think through that might help you respond to the objectives/outcomes/critical questions can be found below:

Did this course provide you with access to voices, perspectives or ideologies that you had not heard before or did not know were there to be heard?
Did it ignore other voices/perspectives/ideologies that you wish you heard more from?
Did you feel that your voice/perspective/ideological frame was represented in the course, and if so/not, how or how not?

GRADING CRITERIA
Grades for this reflection will be based upon completion. If you complete your 2 page reflection, you will receive full credit of 20. If you complete a reflection, but fail to meet the word count, you will receive either 10 or 5 points. If you do not complete your reflection by the due date, you will receive a 0.
Please note that a version of this Reflection is required as part of the Final Portfolio, where it will not be graded as completion, but based upon whether is has met the criteria above! 
HOW TO SUBMIT
Type your reflection in a word document or other supported word processer. Save it, and upload it by clicking the ""Browse"" button and finding it in your files. Then, click ""Submit"" when you are satisfied with your response. You will see the number of words as you type in your word processer. "

What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

In the final week of each unit, we will have a ""Design Week."" This is a week where you get to... design your Unit Portfolio. If you have kept up with your work all unit, this week will be cake for you. You've already both drafted and revised your documents. Now, you get to utilize your peers and instructor's previous feedback to refine your work, gather additional feedback to ensure that you've put forth your best effort, and begin thinking about how to create a portfolio that accentuates the great things about the work that you've developed over the last several weeks.
As a reminder, your professor, your Lab Instructor, and your classmates are your BEST RESOURCES, so USE THEM! And in using them, make sure to be clear about what, exactly, you need out of that interaction. For that purpose, below is a reminder of Elbow and Belanoff's ""Ways of Responding"" that can help guide you in gathering the best possible feedback for your writing. As a reminder, when you are working with your peers, make sure to always ask ""what type of response do you feel would be most helpful for you, so that I can structure my reading of your piece?"" or to provide direction in the form of letting them know what type of feedback that you would like to receive.

What types of feedback will you be seeking from your peers, Lab Instructors, and Professor this week? 
How can this reading help me to effectively navigate writing at the college level beyond this course
How can this reading help me to effectively navigate writing outside of college?
What do I think is the ""big idea"" behind asking us to reread this piece and reflect upon it again?

I've surely said this before in class, but Design Days in the weeks leading up to a portfolio work best when they are loud.

We have been working through this research assignment for two weeks now, and it has become time for it to take shape. You have been working either in opposition to or directly from a problem that you stated you wished to solve in your Writing Assessment Essay, and have been through a Reflection process, including a revision plan. You have been through a Learning process, including creating an annotated bibliography to help you identify gaps in your research and provide a framework upon which it could proceed. Now, it is time to add your voice back into the process, and create a complete draft of your project, which is a form of the planning process. 
Like all research, we have to provide some framework for it to exist. And for this, we are going to go with the standard ""academic"" framework for your piece. You can make determinations about the audience for this piece, but I want at least part of your audience to be an academic one. If you believe that a better audience to help you solve your problem would be a popular one, don't worry- there will be time for that piece in your Final Portfolio, as well.
TASK
You will create a minimum four-page research paper that will adhere to the following guidelines:



The writing must seek to introduce, and then provide some at least partial solution to, a problem that you see in your ""home"" that you plan to take an active part in.
The writing must include reference to ""assets"" that this community has, and seek to utilize them within the solution
The writing must include references to ""needs"" that this community has and how they relate to the problem/solution
The writing must demonstrate the ways that you will be involved in implementing this solution. This should be a realistic solution to a problem that you have the capacity to be a part of the change. And you can be a part of solving huge problems, if you can identify your role in solving them.
The writing must demonstrate the ways that research will be an ongoing component of discovering and implementing your solution. See the Action Research and/or Narrative Inquiry videos earlier for guides on what these research processes can look like, and ""The Advocate"" for a model on what this can look like in practice out in the real world.
The writing must include a minimum of four citations in MLA format, following the guidelines below:


A minimum of one scholarly citation such as a journal article, book, or study

A minimum of one CREDIBLE popular citation such as a newspaper article, newscast or some other credible form of collecting and distributing information with the community.
Encouraged inclusion of primary resources such as interviews with community members, direct observations, tweet by a neighbor, Facebook post from a community page or someone directly impacted or working on the problem, etc.





The writing's format must adhere to the following guidelines:



Begin with an Introduction that will inform the reader of what types of information they are about to read, characterizes the community and their assets/needs, etc.
Include a discussion of the problem that identifies the problem itself and how it manifests within the community. This should emerge directly from your research question and include citations that help the reader to understand the problem and its context.
Include a discussion of the solution that identifies the actions the author will take, personally and communally, to help to resolve the problem, how you are involved, and how research can play an ongoing role in the solution.
End with a conclusion that wraps up the big ideas and helps the reader to understand the totality of the writing
Be in MLA format

This reading will be sort of a model text for us. We will look at the ways that Broaddus uses his characters and their relationships to explore these concepts of home, we will see the ways he utilizes specificity, structure and language in this exploration. And we'll see the ways that he employs distinct rhetorical choices to accomplish various purposes within the text, and occasionally take some time to sit back, take a break from the hustle and bustle, and just discuss our reading and how it relates to our discussions of our writing.

Tanisha Neely,Optional Assignment: Writing Center Visit,0.0,0,0,2022-04-14 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
While I know that all of you are in the Writing Lab and receiving regular feedback and conversations about the class and your writing from your Writing Lab Instructor, as we've learned in class, it is equally important to get different feedback and different perspectives. So, as an opportunity for bonus points, you have this assignment to go to the Writing Center for an appointment, and report back on your experience. 
The Writing Center does similar things that your writing lab will. They will get to know you a little bit, ask some critical questions, find the places where your writing shines, and then work with you on any places where you feel that your writing (ideas/concepts, rhetorical choices, word choices, organization, formatting etc.) can continue to grow. The writing center can work with you from the very beginning of a project, such as when you have a prompt coming up and you want to make sure that you understand it, all the way to the end when you need that last pair of eyes on it. The only difference is that in the ""walk-in"" writing center, you will do this with a fellow student rather than an M.A.-weilding instructor.
You may feel that this will be less beneficial- but the research shows that it is not, in fact. It is simply different. Much the way we've talked about how you all have knowledge that is accessible to you that is valuable that may not necessarily be considered so all the time (like fluency in AAVE or Appalachain English or ""Hick"" as some of you have referred to Southern English), that knowledge is indispensable in some situations. You'll find that your peers will have a lot of that type of knowledge because they are also students who are having to navigate very similar contexts to you. That will give the two of you abilities to better problem-solve together, as co-learners, for these assignments. 
So don't expect your tutors to take charge of the appointments. Go in with an idea of what you'd like to accomplish, and then negotiate with them how you want to approach this co-learning moment for the best of your benefit in this writing project.

Each of us has, over the course of this semester, developed different strategies that have worked with us for revising our work.

We are building a small community in our class, and that requires us to communicate with each other, problem-solve together, and share things as a group. And while I spent a couple of hours typing up that introduction and adding hyperlinks etc., I don't want you all to spend that kind of time on this. Instead, I want you to do it off-the-cuff and real. I want you to create a 2 minute long intro video that gives me and your class mates a sneak peek into who you are.TASKCreate a video between 1 and 2 minutes long that introduces you to your classmates and share it in the discussion board below. If you aren't sure how to do this, there is a really slick online tool called Screencast-o-matic that can really help you out. I have a paid subscription to it because I use it so much, but it's available for free and you won't lose out on any quality in the content you make. If you like another way of making videos, you can use that too, of course. This video should provide some insight into ways that you identify that you are comfortable sharing with the class- identities such as ""an athlete"" or ""a student"" or ""nerd,"" a ""man,"" ""woman,"" or ""nonbinary,"" as ""Black,"" ""Latino,"" or ""white,"" as ""LGBTQ"" etc. etc. Anything that you feel embodies the ""you"" that you want to share with the class. This video should also include some key information about a place that you think of as ""home,"" which doesn't have to be the physical place where you have laid your head at night, but can be the places that are most valuable to you and helped to make you who you are today. Finally, it should include some kind of interesting story from your past that you feel helps to embody who you are. Think about ways to make these videos radiate your personality, and how to connect with your audience. If you're bubbly and happy, put something bright and colorful in your background and make sure to have your best bubbly voice and face on for recording. If you feel as if you're a hard worker, maybe take the video of you while you're nose-deep into the grindstone and end with ""but now I've gotta get back to work."" And if you think your audience is going to respond better to ""Now Imma get back on the grind. We OUT,"" you should sign off that way rather than with the previous version. Do what is gonna help your audience understand you.If you feel like you need an icebreaker formula, you can use the one below:What is your name?What is some community or 'label' that you identify with? What is a place I call home, and what is something about that place that I know that either very few people, or no one else in the world, knows? Tell a story that relates to that factoid.If I could choose anywhere on the planet to be right now, where would I be?OBJECTIVESCreate voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasionUses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes"

One of the best things about a writing class at Marian University is that we prioritize one-on-one interaction with you as writers and as people. In that way, I hope to get to know you as an individual that I can know not only know as a student, but as a person. I hope by some point in this class that we have built a positive relationship that involves trust, understanding and an affinity for exploring the ideas that you love and vibe with through writing. In order to do that, though, I need to meet with you one-on-one rather than in a group of a half-dozen or more. This is the first step in that process.

When we first looked at Maurice Broaddus' Buffalo Soldier, we stopped before entering page 2. In that first page, we were treated to around 200 words of description and place-making, opening questions like ""what does the word 'sacrament' mean here?"" and ""what are chiba leaves?"", meandering through his mother's stories of duppies (what are duppies?) and Old Higue hanging ""her skin along the branch of a cotton tree before she went about her grim business."" It's not until we get to the last line that we get a reference for all of these details... they relate back to the place that Desmond Coke calls home- Jamaica- and his reminiscing of it from ""under the strange western sky.""
However, all of the intricate details of this page are only the introduction to the way that Broaddus weaves specific details through his work to help bring the reader into the story. In chapter 1, you will see phrases like ""Bulbous, bloodshot eyes, like ebony marbles swimming in a skim of yellow"" and ""mud-sluiced street."" These details are not just occasional, they are constant, and in this reading I want you to take intimate notice of them. Then, I want you to imagine the reading without them. Imagine ""The drunk man watched me"" instead of ""bulbous, blood-shot eyes, like ebony marbles swimming in a skim of yellow, tracked him."" Imagine ""the town was dirty"" instead of ""mud-sluiced street."" 
Because all of these things are examples of showing rather than telling on page 15 of the book. Showing allows us, as readers, to experience these sensations as we would in life with all their power, right alongside those within the pages. In life, there are no flashing signs that say THIS TOWN IS UNSAFE. And yet, we immediately gather how unsafe Desmond and Lij are as they enter the town, even if perhaps they don't quite grasp it yet.  

Rather than telling us that the man who confronts Desmond and Lij is drunk, Maurice Broaddus shows us with his actions and description of him. ""Alcohol wafted on his breath."" The color and look of his eyes. His face ""pocked and rugose."" All of these are characteristics of drunkenness, along with his unprompted aggression with ""You got something to say?"" and blocking their path, clearly looking for a fight. 
Rather than telling us ""this town is a dirty, rough, unsafe place,"" Maurice Broaddus shows us through this interaction with the first man they come across, through the ""mud-sluiced streets,"" the ""accumulated stares"" from people, the ""giant steammen"" at patrol dotting the border.

Your exercise for this reading will be to attempt to recognize the impact of specific detail, specifically moments of showing through description in Chapter 1 of Buffalo Soldier, imagine how what is being shown here would have been different if it were told instead, and, finally, to think about how you can apply this to your own writing that you are drafting right now, in this class.
TASK
The assignment has two primary steps: First, read. Second, respond.
READ: Buffalo Soldier, Chapter 1
RESPOND: In three parts



Quote one passage that demonstrates showing through description in Chapter 1
Imagine how what is being shown through description were told directly instead. What would it say? How would that change the experience for you as a reader?
Write two final sentences about specific sections of your Home That Built Me, I Am From or My Page 1 that you can continue to develop using showing through description rather than telling directly.



HOW YOU WILL BE GRADED
A completed assignment will be awarded a score of between 1 and 5. 



5: You have satisfactorily completed the assignment and all of its attributes
2-4: You completed the assignment but missed one or more attributes I was asking for
1: You did something, though it wasn't really what I asked for.

PURPOSE
You are all, as you know, now members of the Near Northwest Neighborhood, which is really a collection of neighborhoods just northwest of downtown between 38th and 10th, Kessler and Meridian. And one of the purposes of this class is to help you discover, uncover, and more deeply understand communities that you are a part of through acts of inquiry, reading and writing. This is one such opportunity.
Flanner House has been a mainstay and rock within this community for more than 50 years, and is a central hub for much of the work that goes on within it. We'll take a brief tour of Flanner House, your professor will buy you coffee, and you'll get to see Cleo's Bodega (and hear its history), Ujamaa Bookstore (and hear its history) and purchase a copy of Buffalo Soldier, the only required text for this course. If we're lucky (and he is available), the author may even make an appearance at the bookstore to sign your copy!

Via IndyGo Route 15, which will depart from the 30th Street and Cold Spring stop at 10:41 a.m. To attend in this manner, you should arrive at the stop no later than 10:35 a.m. Your professor will pay your fare both for the ride to Flanner House and your return ride, departing from Flanner House at 12:31 p.m.
2. Drive, walk, or otherwise make it to Cleo's Bodega by 11 a.m. and leave around 12 p.m.
3. Take part in a walk around Flanner House campus between 11 a.m. and 12 p.m., including Cleo's Bodega and Coffee Shop, Flanner Farms and Ujamaa Bookstore on the Flanner House grounds. This will include conversation about the histories of these institutions and how they relate or will relate to course content.
HOW TO EARN BONUS POINTS
If you attend the day and aren't a jerk, you get 5 bonus points, plus a fantastic new place for you to call part of your neighborhood like a location for quick groceries, a fantastic coffee shop and off-campus study space, and a chill bookstore with lots of events by local artists and writers! 
IMPORTANT NOTE FOR SAVVY STUDENTS
You may have noticed that many of the things on the above list are also cross-listed in your ""community gaming"" bonus points section of your syllabus. Yes, if you follow the guidelines for the community gaming bonus points, these bonus points will ""stack"" with those, as well. By my math, you could earn as many as 10-12 bonus points by attending and taking advantage of this tour!"
Tanisha Neely,Class Reading 3/23: Annotated Bibliographis,1.0,0.0012315270935960591,0.0,2022-03-23 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
We have already done an annotated bibliography for this class as a way of textual map-building. And yet, there are many other purposes for doing annotated bibliographies, as we've talked about throughout class, and each one of them can be a means of supporting your writing process. One of the ways that we'll be using them is to literally cut and arrange our resources to help determine how best to utilize them, what narrative is emerging from the resources, and what gaps we have in our narrative that need further research. However, before we get to that point I want you all to understand them just a little bit better. For that reason, our reading today is going to focus on annotated bibliographies. 
TASK
READ

Purdue Owl, ""Annotated Bibliographies""

Purdue Owl, Example MLA Annotated Bibliography


WRITE
A 100-word reflection on this reading that answers the following questions:



How is this assignment similar to or different than assignments I've had in the past?
What did I learn during this reading about annotated bibliographies that can assist me in completing the annotated bibliography and research project?
How can this information be useful for me beyond this course in other courses, and even beyond my time at university?

As we are working on our research writing and discussions of research, I don't want us to lose sight of the work that we've been doing all semester with focusing on really critical things like home and specificity and structure and language choices. For that reason, while we're working on your research project, we will also be continuing to read a novel by Maurice Broaddus with a strong theme of home, especially for characters who are, objectively, very far from the place that they have always called home. 
This reading will be sort of a model text for us. We will look at the ways that Broaddus uses his characters and their relationships to explore these concepts of home, we will see the ways he utilizes specificity, structure and language in this exploration. And we'll see the ways that he employs distinct rhetorical choices to accomplish various purposes within the text, and occasionally take some time to sit back, take a break from the hustle and bustle, and just discuss our reading and how it relates to our discussions of our writing.

Tanisha Neely,Week 11 Overview,0.0,0,0,2022-03-28 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Unit 3, as you may have noticed, is entirely dedicated to two things: 

Helping you to revise your idea of ""research"" and figure out a way to incorporate it into how you can make sense of the world
Helping you to revise your idea of ""revision"" and figure out a way to incorporate it into how you can make sense of the world

But there is a third thing that we have sort of touched upon, but I want to make more explicit now. We have been building toward this all semester, and it's time to bring it out in the open. And that is this:

Reminding you what you've known all along- that you and your words have a power. That you and your word matter. That you and your writing can do great things. That that research, revision, and writing can be- and are- both a form of and precursor to actions. Actions YOU are capable of. Actions that utilize both with your previous knowledge and experience and the knowledge and experience you've gained in this class. Actions which can, if you choose to, help bring about a better world filled with Peace and Justice.

This week we will be basing our discussions and work around these principles and answering these questions for you, personally. What is ""research"" to you, and how can it be of use to you and the world you want to build? How can the concepts of ""revision"" we've been talking through this semester help you to achieve those goals? And what powers do you and your voice have to help bring about greater Peace and Justice in the world?

After viewing The Advocate, a story about Maurice Young and his advocacy relationship to the homeless community in Indianapolis, what questions do you have? 
One question I have is... well, did it work?
And, hopefully, that's a question that you are left with, as well. And that's, really where research begins. With a question. And for this assignment, you are going to spend just a little bit of time looking into an answer for that- the ""learning"" portion of research.
TASK
For this assignment, you'll need to do a bit of digging into the current state of homelessness in Indianapolis compared to where it was in 2015 at the release of The Advocate. 
RESEARCH



A minimum of 3 credible sources providing information on the state of homelessness in Indianapolis in 2015 and then any point between then and 2021



WRITE



A 100-word reflection on the methods that you utilized in:

locating your sources
evaluating your sources (were there any you declined to use due to dubiousness?)
synthesizing your sources into a narrative (how did you determine what these resources say together?)
Cite your sources in MLA format

This is it! We are finishing our course text, Buffalo Soldier. Along the way, we've focused heavily on how the writing emphasizes our theme of home, as well as the things we have been learning about writing along the way- specificity and structure and language choices.
What you might not know is that the author of this text is not only a highly-acclaimed and incredibly in demand Afrofuturist author. But, he's also a friend of mine who lives right here in Indianapolis and teaches middle school. He may or may not be able to speak with us this semester, but every time he does, he emphasizes over and over and over again two things that you must do as a writer: Read critically, and revise. When he talks about his writing process, he talks about how there can be up to seven completely new versions of a novel before he even knows what he's really writing about. And then after that there are dozens more.
If you don't feel great about your first drafts, your second drafts, or even your third drafts, just remember- someone who writes two books, dozens of short stories and dozens more articles, pamphlets, etc. and leads writing workshops for the community in his home as well as chairing international writing conferences isn't usually happy with his, either. But with time, he turns out work that looks like what you've read in this class.

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

WRITE
Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.


Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

Research in learning has routinely shown us that learning is much more complicated than simply looking at and digesting information. To learn material so that you are capable of applying that learning in new situations, there are significant hurdles to that acquisition, then detection of moments when the learning is truly applicable, electing to utilize that learning in this moment, and finally reflecting upon that learning to decide not just that you will utilize it, but how  you will adapt it to this new scenario.  One of the models for this that has proven most effective is the following:
Preview



Attend
Review
Study
Assess



This means that before you undertake a learning opportunity such this week of class, you will be looking forward to the learning moment and think about what you might be asked to do/learn and take an honest look at your current understandings of the subject and expectations. You must then attend class, of course. But after class, you should review what took place in class and reflect upon its impact and the ways it fits in with other learning.
This assignment begins this three-part framework for this unit. I can't really structure your study (other than building in writing assignments) or your accessing your learning in other learning scenarios, but I can create a preflection, learning and reflection dynamic. And this assignment is the first step in that dynamic- this preview or preflection stage of the learning process.
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple question below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



Based on the knowledge and experience I have at my disposal now, what do I expect from this week of the course, and from where do I think those expectations emerge?



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the best possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task- include all of the things I ask from you, and while showcasing each individual piece, also feel like a single, cohesive piece of art. You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:

At the front of the portfolio, an Artist's Statement of at least 100 words
At the end, a reflection of at least 100 words (can be very similar to your end of unit reflection)

At any place that fits best, a newly revised version of a piece from your Unit 1 Portfolio
At any place that fits best, a newly revised version of a piece from your Unit 2 Portfolio
At any place that fits best, a revised version of your Research Project



GRADING CRITERIA
Your portfolio will be graded using this rubric 
RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES



Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing

As we have emphasized strongly in this class all year, Writing is Revising. Writing is not drafting. Writing is not editing. Scholars have found that professional writers spend around 90% of their time revising.
This can look like a lot of different things, and we have experienced some of them in this class. Feedback from lab instructors, peers in your class or peers in the Writing Center. We have learned about twelve different types of feedback you can ask for. We have learned about revision about helping yourself to ""Re-Envision"" your focus, your organization, or your purpose. We have even created Peer Review Forms and Revision Plans for your documents. And we've talked through other blended revision/drafting techniques like redrafting, venn diagrams, word association, and more. And importantly, we have learned how to utilize Rhetorical Grammar- using ""grammar,"" or the structure by which we form thoughts through writing, in a purposeful manner to communicate in intended ways with an audience, even breaking ""grammatical rules"" in order to fulfill that goal- and multiple Englishes and other languages available to us as resources.
Now is time to put that learning into action to bring your works, which up to this point have been process drafts, into another gear. I know you all have more that you can give. You can rework that My Page 1 into a work of Flash Fiction. You can reconfigure your Home That Built Me into a letter to your mother to let her know how you've grown since the day you first met 18 years ago, and that you'll be okay now that you've left to go off to college. You can reconfigure your ""Re-Mix"" essay to bring that section that you really needed later in the piece to be there and do what it needs to do, and revise sections to more effectively stick to the thematic purpose. And you can reconfigure your research to be, instead of addressed to an academic or ""professional"" audience, addressed directly to the business owners in your community to ask for support in your efforts to build a better community that embodies Peace and Justice. 
TASK
Choose one of your works from Portfolios 1, 2 or 3 that you will be revising for your Final Portfolio, and using this Revision Plan Worksheet, complete a Revision Plan for that assignment. Remember, you will have a little over THREE FULL WEEKS to complete this revision plan, so you should set your goals accordingly. This revision plan should:



Answer each line fully and completely. Short and uninspired answers will not do.
Demonstrate a level of deep thought about each line. ""Everyone benefits and no one loses out"" is not an acceptable answer.
Create a concrete plan of revision. Where will you focus your energy (focus, organization or purpose?), what strategies will you use, and to whom will this piece now speak?



Your revision plan can, if necessary, include an accompanying paragraph with any questions, concerns, or context that you wish to present to your professor.

Like every other portfolio you've turned in in this class, the Final Portfolio is a chance for you to demonstrate the ways that you've applied what we've learned in class to your writing projects. The only difference between this one and your last 3- besides that you've had three times to practice now- is that this portfolio is an opportunity to showcase your work and growth throughout the entire course.
As we've discussed many times in class, the measure of a writer is not how cleanly they can get words down on paper the first try, but the process by which they move from concept to polish. The best writers, in other words, are not those who can vomit most efficiently onto the page, but those who are the most tenacious, stick with it the longest, apply their learning, and come to a final product conscious and confident of its eventual impact on the audience. This portfolio is a chance for you to show that trait in yourself through your writing and its growth.
***
This portfolio's intent is outlined in the course syllabus, and is meant to demonstrate your ability aligning with the following General Education Objectives:
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes;
And Course Outcomes:
a. Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
b. Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
c. Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
d. Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .
***
You have, throughout this unit, been asked to interpret meaning from different information mediums like text, audio, video and image, as well as a range of information presentation types from maps to articles to documentaries. You've been asked to communicate within a range of purposes, from informative research to inquiry to opinion to persuasion, within a wide variety of genres. 
You have been asked to utilize various techniques discussed in class such as showing/telling, naming and structure, as well as a range of evidence strategies from emotional/logical to anecdotal to communal to scholarly. Your audiences have been both academic and non-academic, they have required multiple perspectives and critical inquiry into who benefits/is left out, who gets to speak/is silenced, and what ideologies are present/ignored. And, through your reflective writing and reading strategies we've learned, you've been asked to reflect on how these writings bear upon your ideas of research, language choices, writing, and our ever constant theme of ""home.""
We've been working on this all semester working up to this revision-focused portfolio, and you are now prepared to demonstrate that learning. 
Instructions
In a single document, you will combine the following writing projects
First- An Artist's Statement, designed to prepare your reader for what they will be reading. This should set me up to view the rest of your portfolio through the lens you'd like me to see it. Do you want me to see your growth as a writer? Do you want me to see the way you've really attacked ""naming"" as a strategy? Do you want me to see the contrast between the different types/genres of research writing you've undertaken? Set me up to read it that way not just with your words, but with good writing that utilizes the very strategies we've been talking about all semester from naming to showing vs. telling to meaning-making structure, and even references to the text if that will be helpful. 
Next- In whatever order you deem most appropriate for the way you'd like me to read your Unit 3 Portfolio:
A Unit 1 Section, consisting of: 

Your chosen document from Unit 1 in its original version from Portfolio 1
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 1
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing

A Unit 2 Section, consisting of: 

Your chosen document from Unit 2 in its original version from Portfolio 2
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 2
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing

A Unit 3 Section, consisting of:

Your chosen document from Unit 3 in its original version from Portfolio 3
A revised version of your chosen document from Unit 3
A one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing

A minimum of one additional writing, meant to demonstrate your overall growth through this class, in its original version, its revised version, and a one paragraph reflection on how your learning in this class led to the changes I will recognize in this writing

A link to the Class Mapping Project, with a brief explanation of how to find your contributions to this project.

 
Last- Your Final Course Reflection. If you need to edit this for submission, you may. It should work as a bookend to your Artist's Statement and build upon the mini-reflections within each section, telling me not what should I expect but what learning did I just witness in these pages? I should leave the final section of your portfolio feeling that I understand not only what growth was demonstrated in your writing, but what growth have you undergone that cannot be seen in texts or you were not able to effectively demonstrate with the texts that you've chosen, and what growth you have undergone as a writer and thinker over the course of this semester. Most importantly, I want to know how you plan to utilize that growth as you move through your collegiate and post-collegiate life, and why that growth is a valuable asset to you now and in the future both as a student and a person living life on this earth.

GRADING CRITERIA
There are 100 total points available for the Final Portfolio, broken up into 5 categories of 20 points each. These categories follow the values set forth by your instructor from the very beginning of the course.
20 Points for Process
 I should be able to look back at your Draft 1 of each of your works and see a concerted effort and movement in each of the pieces. Evidence that you've tried out new things and made significant effort to see where your writing can take you in developing your piece toward its final draft is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
20 Points for Rhetorical Effectiveness
I should be able to see the meaning that you are working toward, and see the ways that the choices you've made in writing are meant to lead your intended audience toward your purpose. This is the does your writing do what you want it to criteria. Evidence that your writing has a clear purpose, intended audience, and follows the expectations of that audience in ways that are beneficial to effectively ""moving"" them is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
20 Points for Structural Soundness
I should be able to see that you are intentionally utilizing structure as a meaning-making tool. While readability is absolutely a top-notch concern here, for full credit in this category I want to see that the sentence, paragraph, page etc. structure you've chosen is a conscious- not unconscious- method of ""moving"" your audience in line with your purpose.
20 Points for Linguistic Choice and Efficacy
This absolutely does not mean that you must use *Standard English in your writing. What it does mean is that the linguistic choices that you make- from Naming to Show vs Tell to the use of that ""other"" language in your writing like ands, buts, thoughs, howevers etc. are conscious- not unconscious- choices meant to ""move"" your audience in line with your purpose.
20 Points for Response to Prompt
To receive full credit in this category, each piece must effectively respond to the prompt in its entirety. This does not always mean direclty answering every question in the prompt. It does, however, mean writing along the subject lines the prompt asks for, writing in the genre the prompt asks for, and following any guidelines set forth by the prompt. 
HOW TO SUBMIT
There are multiple ways to construct your portfolio, but it should be submitted either as a link to a webpage like Wix or a Word Online doc, or as a file such as a Power Point or Word document. Ensure that you are taking into account how your portfolio will appear visually in whatever format you choose. As we talked about in our unit on Structure, the way your writing presents visually is part of the rhetorical choices you make and one of the ways you create meaning and readability!
One final bit of advice: While you definitely want to let me know which piece in your portfolio is which, creating TITLES are a huge help toward building a full piece of writing! Titles are the first thing a reader sees when they open up your document, and ""Unit 3 Portfolio"" is not nearly as compelling or as effective at providing a reader an effective starting point as ""It's Alive: Research in the Real World through a College Freshman's Eyes"" and ""Homelessness Research Project"" is not as emotionally thwacking as ""When Your City Doesn't Want You"" or ""Solidarity Beneath Davidson Street."""
Tanisha Neely,Class Preflection,10.0,0.012315270935960592,0.0,2022-08-22 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Research in learning has routinely shown us that learning is much more complicated than simply looking at and digesting information. To learn material so that you are capable of applying that learning in new situations, there are significant hurdles to that acquisition, then detection moments when the learning is truly applicable, electing to utilize that learning in this moment, and then reflecting upon that learning to decide not just that you will utilize it, but how  you will adapt it to this new scenario.  One of the models for this that has proven most effective is the following:



Preview
Attend
Review
Study
Assess



This means that before you undertake a learning opportunity such as class, you need to look forward to the learning moment and think about what you might be asked to do/learn and take an honest look at your current understandings of the subject and expectations of the day. You must then attend class, of course. But after class, you should review what took place in class and reflect upon its impact and the ways it fits in with other learning.
This assignment begins this three-part framework. I can't really structure your study (other than building in writing assignments) or your accessing your learning in other learning scenarios, but I can create a preflection, learning and reflection dynamic. And this assignment is the first step in that dynamic- this preview or preflection stage of the learning process.
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple question below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



Based on the knowledge and experience I have at my disposal now, what do I expect from this course, and from where do you think those expectations emerge?



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I will highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

As we are building up our ability to tell our story of our home(s), there are some genres that are highly illustrative of the tools available to us. Poetry is one of those genres, because quite often, poetry eschews the narrative and expository elements of writing that are often fore-fronted in other genres. So while we are entering this place, we're going to take a look at a good bit of poetry that does exactly this. Some of these poems will even be examples of the ""I Am From"" poem that we will be writing in class to provide you with a template for the work you'll be doing yourself.

As we've been talking about the spaces around us, we've been slowly working toward making the connection back to how these things relate to our language and relationships to learning and writing. Now, these two things are going to slam squarely into each other for this reading.
You may have heard in the past people talk about what it means to speak ""Correctly."" Well, I'm here to tell you that, unfortunately, they're usually flat out wrong. In fact, they probably don't speak what they view as ""correctly"" themselves! Even teachers, it turns out, who harp on ""correctness"" are often simply responding to various pet peeves that they have rather than anything supported by actual linguistic research. Their perceptions about what is ""correct"" aren't informed by this research. So... what are they informed by?
Clearly, communication is not just about the linguistic patterns used. There are lots and lots of things that language is about, though. And that's what this piece will delve into. But more importantly, it will reframe what you may have set in mind that are ""Bad Ideas About Writing"" into good ideas about writing.
When you read this piece, reflect upon yourself. In what spaces do you feel most comfortable, and how do you think that the relationship between your primary or ""home"" Discourse(s) and the Discourse of other spaces where you feel less comfortable might impact those feelings and your ability to effectively navigate within those spaces?

When you think of ""home,"" what do you think of? I'm sure that, for many of us, it is a physical structure and we are pretty dang sure that that's the thing that home means. We even have terms for people who don't have that- homeless. But one theme that you are going to notice in this course is that when things seem obvious, that is exactly the moment that we need to engage our critical questions to further examine that topic, because not many things are as simple as they seem.
One place we will routinely visit to illuminate difficult or seemingly simple topics that are likely much more complex are histories. Histories can provide us glimpses into the world before this concept, and what conditions were brought together to bring this concept into the world. And this is what we will be doing with this first reading. How did the concept of ""home"" come to be? And, more importantly, what don't we already know about this concept that might shift our understanding of it?

Tanisha Neely,Exploratory Draft: The Home That Built Me,5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2022-08-31 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Exploratory Drafts will become something you'll do for every large assignment in this course. Their purpose is not to create something perfect or even something acceptable, but rather to simply create something. This is a moment for you to, as Ms. Frizzle says, ""make mistakes, take chances, and get messy!"" Try things out. Feel out your thoughts. See what's going on in there, and... explore. You will absolutely not be graded upon your ability to write something ""perfect"" on your first try. You will, however, be graded on whether you tried.
""The Home That Built Me"" is an exploration into the ways that linguistic identity, writer identity, and environment interplay. You'll use the content that you've created so far through your My Page 1 and I Am From writings as a starting point for this essay, and build from there using the attributes of Discourses we can glean from our readings. This will be an exploration of who you are in language, and perhaps your first opportunity to look deeply at the ways that your environment and the ways you identify through language relate. As we've said before, these things are the water in which we swim, and are therefore often completely unexamined in our lives- and that's where some connections that can be highly illuminating may be able to hide. It's your job to work toward making those connections in this assignment.
TASK
Create a draft of an essay that begins the process of exploring the relationship between the spaces you consider ""home"" and your linguistic identity, using the lens of Discourse(s) to assist. It should adhere to the following criteria to be considered a success:



Your draft should demonstrate the beginnings of a piece that will end at a minimum of 4 pages
Your draft should incorporate and built on some of the elements present in previous essays
Your draft should begin to draw on ideas from the readings, incorporating the language of and touching on the concept of Discourses:

ways of speaking
ways of listening
ways of reading and/or writing
ways of acting
ways of interacting
ways of valuing
ways of feeling
ways of dressing
ways of thinking
ways of believing


Your draft should include at least one image
Your draft should utilize appropriate Englishes or other languages to evoke intended audience

In our short week this week, we will be taking our opportunity to meet in class to discuss our exploratory drafts of ""The Home That Built Me."" To do so, we need a bit of context. Many of you may not have ever reviewed your peers' work before, and that's perfectly fine. We're going to learn a good bit about how, exactly, to go about doing that before we jump in. The first thing to learn, of course, is how exactly one CAN respond to your peers' writing.
Peter Elbow- a towering figure in the field of writing studies- and Pat Belanoff have summarized some of their academic work in an attempt to provide you with a digestible framework for responding to your peers writing. Every one-on-one communication has two parties, and when it comes to writing there is always a ready-made idea, or text, upon which the conversation will focus. So many of the conversational categories have already been handled. However, there are others that one needs to deal with, and in particular when we're dealing with the subject of writing where identity is so interwoven into our subject matter, we need to be sure that we're responding in ways that will be beneficial to our counterpart. That's why the very first thing you should do after you introduce yourself and ask a little bit about your peer's background like where they're from and what they feel is most special about the linguistic identity that emerges from that place is ""what type of response do you feel would be most helpful for you, so that I can structure my reading of your piece?""

On Monday, we were introduced to the concept of Discourses. Today, we're going to continue to explore that concept in an article that's a decent bit more ""academic"" in its language. There are probably going to be a few things in there that you're not going to follow, and that's perfectly fine- this piece is built for professors who are looking to get better in their teaching practice. But the biggest thing here for you to see is the list of things that the author brings into their definition of Discourse- ""ways of speaking, listening, reading, and/or writing integrated with ways of acting, interacting, valuing, feeling, dressing, thinking, and believing-"" and the ways that these Discourses can have a documented impact on the ways that we, as humans, interact with each other and the types of outcomes that can emerge when there is unexamined ""Discourse tension"" in a classroom setting.
Have you experienced this ""Discourse tension"" in your life before? In the classroom, even?
For an example of Discourse Tension, I've included a TED Talk by the glorious Dr. Jamyla Lyiscott. In it, she talks about the tensions between her ""three ways to speak English"" that she navigates day in and day out as a Black woman in academia. Pay attention to when she notes moments of tension, and within/between which communities those tensions arise and why. How does her English change to meet the needs of different communities? Why does she have to change, and do others as well? Or is it just her? Why or why not?

We've spent a little bit of time speaking about how Discourse Tension can impact educational relationships and opportunities, and have a fairly minimal example of that happening, but without a whole lot of details. But how, exactly, can that Discourse Tension actually impact the realities of people in the world, and what, exactly, can we do about it? What types of people are effected by this Discourse Tension, and how can it be resolved? These are questions that a PhD in Education with a focus on linguistics and literacy in young children can address, and does in the article we'll be reading today. When reading, I want you to imagine yourself in the shoes of the people that Dr. Purcell-Gates refers to- and not just the two people who are constructed as being ""in the right,"" per se. I want you to also see yourself in the villains of these stories, and think back... have I ever been the villain in these stories? Why are they cast as the villains? What behaviors does Dr. Purcell-Gates use to portray them as such? And what alternative behaviors exist? What social pressures led them to act villainous, and how do those social pressures act in other ways? Have they acted on me?
As a Marian University student, which of the Franciscan Values applies to this situation, and how can we work to embody those values it in our Discourse Relationships?
Discussion and understanding of some of the key arguments in this work will be crucial to being able to effectively participate in next week's reading and discussion, so make sure you've got this down because next week will build off of this!

We've talked about this idea of Discourse Tension and examined some of the concrete ways that certain populations can feel and be effected by this concept. And we've talked about a few of the ways that this Discourse Tension can be resolved in teacher/student relationships. Now, we're going to look at an additional dimension of this conversation that involves race and its long and tense history in this country and elsewhere. Lisa Delpit does a really solid job of laying out a (very recent) history of the journey Black English has taken while analyzing her personal struggle with what WEB DuBois called ""The Double Consciousness,"" the need to appease predominantly white, middle/upper class Discourses while trying to retain identity. Lee Tonouchi, celebrated author and speaker of the language known as ""Hawaiian Pidgin,"" as well, takes a stand on this issue with his graduation speech to graduates of the University of Hawaii. 
The Franciscan Value of the year at Marian University is Peace and Justice, and during our class discussion around this topic (following a very brief lecture by myself to provide some additional context as to why this conversation is necessary). How is linguistic justice directly related to racial justice? To economic justice? To justice of space and place (we'll explore this more later!)? And, most of all, what does Peace and Justice look like?

Tanisha Neely,Draft 2: The Home That Built Me,10.0,0.012315270935960592,0.0,2022-02-02 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Note: Writing for this piece should be in the language that you speak with your friends and family from these ""home"" locations.
Writing, as we've mentioned many times before, is a process, and one that can happen alongside new learning or even facilitate that new learning. In this case, it could potentially be both. Your first draft of your ""The Home That Built Me"" essay focused around the concept of Discourses and drew from your two previous writings that focused around place, space and description. Moving into this next level, I'm going to again ask for some significant revisions as we hone in on what this piece can become.
TASK
For your second draft of this piece, I want to see three types of progress:

I want to see that you've located some core elements from your exploratory draft (which emerged from your ""My Page 1"" and ""I Am From..."") to develop, and have written your draft around those elements. Do not turn in a slightly revised version of your exploratory draft. Minor revisions will not receive credit. 

That you've begun developing your writing around emerging understandings of language, space and place, and the questions in the prompt below. You absolutely do not have to (and should not) answer all of these questions. These are merely jumping-off points for you to engage in a discussion of your own Discourse(s). Absolutely do not turn in a draft that follows each question in order. This is not a short answer assignment. I do, however, want to see in your writing that you have given thought to these questions and at least a few have significantly informed your draft.
The inclusion of at least three course materials such as Suci Madidji's ""Discourses"" or Lisa Delpit's ""No Kinda Sense"" etc. In addition, all important locations should be cited by their Google Earth coordinates. All citations should have an in-text component, as well as a Works Cited component in MLA format.

Your second draft of ""The Home That Built Me"" should:



Be at least four pages in length, not including your works cited.
Include text and at least one image (such as those form your Visual Identity Project) effectively integrated into that text. You may also include graphics/figures, hyperlinked audio, or any other medium that will effectively help your writing accomplish its purpose.
Be written at least partly in a language that you would consider your ""home language"" with at least some description of what that is and means.
Demonstrate how key ideas from course readings, videos etc. can inform your ideas of your Discourse Identity.
Respond in some way to at least several of the following questions:



Your guiding question that you must respond to for this draft is:
How has your Discourse Identity emerged from the spaces, persons and experiences in your life to effect the ways you can navigate the world today?
Questions you can utilize in answering this guiding question:



What places were important to me as I grew up and what communities were present there?

Note: You have already begun to answer this question, so it behooves you to utilize it to grow! What Discourses do I enact within my community/communities, and in what ways are they enacted? Can you draw on experiences from actual or possible dialogues that you can portray to your reader? Remember, Discourses include:



ways of speaking
ways of listening
ways of reading and/or writing
ways of acting
ways of interacting
ways of valuing
ways of feeling
ways of dressing
ways of thinking
ways of believing


How do the bodies of people within your Discourse(s) move through space in relation to each other bodies (kinesics)?
What are the markers of ""us"" vs ""them"" in your Discourse and how are those in-group and out-group  statuses made known? How do you know someone who could be from or fit in well with your Discourse(s) when meeting them for the first time?
How does your home community's Discourse look to other people? How does it appear to ""academia,"" or the ""professional"" or ""scholarly"" world?
Have you seen instances of Discourse Tension with other Discourse communities? What were the results of this tension?
Is there Discourse Tension within YOU (WEB DuBois' ""The Double Consciousness""), and how do YOU feel about your home Discourse?
Do you switch between Discourses (code-switching)? If so/not, how? And why do you think this is true of you?

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers.

This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this unit and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper.

Every text, whether it is delivered in an image, a chart, a memo, an article or a meme includes author(s) who are making intentional (though perhaps not conscious) choices about what to include. And while these choices, at times, may seem random or arbitrary, they are not. The fields that we have ventured into in this class- those of sociolinguistics, rhetorics, and writing studies, all are very aware that these choices are the result of the choices that have been made in the past, linked to events stretching back and back and back- especially those events that feel ""normal"" or ""natural."" Their normal-ness and natural-ness is born of recurrence, until those choices seem to be the only ones a writer can make. 
But as a class of individuals looking at these choices in an informed and conscious manner, we know different. There are always other choices that can be made, and there are always people already making those choices. Often, those choices are not the ones we (if we're in the group that sees ""normalness"" in what is often called the ""dominant"" perspective) can see without actively seeking them out.
In these readings, we're going to take a look at one of the formats that is often seen as the most normal and natural- a map. How, do you ask, could a map hide anything? It's literally their job to show us things! Or... is it? As we are looking at these maps and looking at the hidden, silenced or alternative perspectives available to us through the use of Critical Questions like ""who gets to speak/is left out?"" ""which perspectives are offered/silenced?"" and ""Who benefits?"" we will often see beneath the surface level and find out that what communications intend and what they do can be radically different. So what, exactly, do the maps you'll see below really do?

When we think of maps and places, we often think about these things as neutral and ahistorical. They are what they are, and that's what they are. When we go to the Yats on Indiana Avenue, there is no history dripping from the walls. We don't see the ghosts of the past immediately on the surface. Things seem as if they have always been and always will be.
But if we think about this for more than just a moment, we know that this is not true. History DOES drip from the walls- just invisibly in the ways that we reckon with the present. Yats would not be there if it weren't for IUPUI. And IUPUI would not be there without a very particular word, ""blight."" And that word would not have existed without segregation, and Indiana's role as a hub of the Klan in the 1910's, 20's and even 30's. And segregation would not have existed without the Union victory in the civil war (and the KKK's victories in the subsequent terrorist-ruled south) that led to a great migration of Black men and women from the South into Indianapolis. And there never would've even been an Indianapolis if it hadn't been for settlers breaking the Royal Proclamation of 1763.
Just as important, not all histories are created equal in that not all histories are readily told. Some histories are readily available to us, like the Crispus Attucks wins in Indiana State Basketball memorialized downtown at the IHSAA Hall of Fame. Far less told is what happened afterward- when the team's victory parade- a parade that had happened every year for the winner of the championship for decades- was rerouted away from downtown due to the perception that Black fans would be violent. This happened again in 1956 after winning their second straight title- after which basketball star Oscar Robertson simply went home rather than face what he deemed a humiliating ""second-class celebration."" Fun fact- you may also know a little bit about the team that won the year before in 1954- the Milan High School Indians, the team memorialized in the movie Hoosiers and the team Hollywood made the intentional choice to immortalize on the silver screen despite essentially making up the whole thing beside the fact that they won a state title. 
For this reading, we're going to investigate the ways that histories continue to live today in the stories that we tell about places and spaces, and the very real lived experiences of people who inhabit those spaces. I want you to look for ways that our ideas of Discourse Tensions could overlap the maps and articles that we will be reading, and think through what Peace and Justice might mean given what we are learning.

While we have been looking at maps, we've been talking about some of the rhetorical choices that go into map design and how those decisions effect the not intended, but real function of those maps and how they can actively effect the lives of others. This, of course, is not only true of maps. Not all writing effects lives in the same ways, and poetry probably doesn't have the same tangible consequences upon our lives as mapping, but one of the key facts about writing is that it does effect you in some way.
One of those rhetorical decisions we've been focusing on is the structure of those pieces. How are the elements organized so as to communicate with and effect the reader? In the following pieces, I want you to focus on that structure. What does the structure communicate between these pieces? How are they different, and what effect does that have upon the way it effects you? Most important, how can you make intentional rhetorical decisions about structure in order to facilitate a certain effect?

Tanisha Neely,Week 7 Overview: The Structures That Build Us,0.0,0,0,2022-02-21 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
Last week, we spent time looking at writing structures and the ways they can actually serve to craft ideas of physical space and, therefore, even our physical space itself. This week, we'll be taking that lesson forward into our writing in a bit more subtle ways. For instance, how can we utilize a typically-boring structural element- the works cited- to help enrich the textual/hypertextual world of our writing? What purposes can this type of structure serve, and which purposes do I want it to serve? And how can structure in writing serve as a meaning-making tool, to help craft my understandings of a piece of writing?
We'll seek out the ways that structure can almost literally transport your reader from one place to another, and even think about the ways that changing the organization of your work- one of the elements of structure- can change the possible meaning that can be gleaned from it. Then, we'll get to work creating a piece that is most likely a radical structural departure from any work that you've ever done before- our ""Re-Mix Essay.""

Let me tell you a secret. I hate formatting. I hate it. I run a writing center on campus, and hate it. And yet, it's something that I don't save to the end of a project like a lot of things that I hate to do like painting my shed (still need to do that) or trimming when I mow. I do it right at the beginning, because I've recognized something about formatting. When done in a particular way with an eye toward its utility, it can be incredibly useful.
First off, formatting hasn't, historically, been meant for writers. Instead, it's been meant for readers. An in-text citation, footnote or works cited are what are called hypertextual elements-- ways that you can guide your readers beyond your text to supplement your own argumentation and provide substantiation through the work of others. In our use of these formatting styles, it can also transport readers spatially to places we want them to see and experience through media beyond the orthographic text. You see, formatting, used purposefully and with an eye on the message you are crafting and how your audiences are likely to navigate your work can create a far richer, more captivating and potentially more persuasive experience for your reader, bolstering the effectiveness of your writing without having to write a single additional word.
Second, an annotated bibliography can be a great window into asking yourself who you are allowing time to speak in your writing. If, for instance, you were writing a history of the American Revolution and, looking through your notes, you see British political voices, American political voices, and French political voices, you could ask yourself ""who else had a role and stake in the American Revolution who I haven't included?"" The answers might include the hundreds of thousands of people living on the continent who did not belong to those groups, but definitely had a role in the conflict such as the various Algonquin nations (Iroquois being a prominent member), Black people who were enslaved on the continent or Black freedmen, women who were shut out of the political process, poorer white men who did not have the platform of a political position, other groups who today we consider ""white"" who at the time would not have been considered as such, etc. And perhaps you may have never even noticed these omissions if you hadn't seen all of your citations in one place.
Third, there are lots of programs that can help you with formatting- if you commit to them from the get-go. We're in the age of automation, and formatting hasn't been exempted from that. There are lots of really, really bad ones (PLEASE don't use easybib or online software like that. It gets things wrong more than right), but there are some really, really good ones as well like Mendeley, EndNote and Academic Writer (for APA, the program in which I wrote my thesis). And these programs not only tackle formatting for you, but they can automatically create and format in-text and bibliographic citations, help you to chain research, offer similar articles via in-program suggestion or even on a regular basis via email if you have a research area you are really interested in, and guide you through the process of crafting a paper in a certain formatting style in ways that become worry-free.
It's with these two things in mind- the ways that we can use formatting to craft a more valuable reader experience and the ways that beginning in an effective environment can craft a more valuable writer experience- that we enter this next phase of our writing journey in this class. I don't want you to think of formatting, like I did as a college freshman, as that tedious thing that I have to do so my teachers don't steal points from me. I want you to think about it as a dynamic method of engaging in an inquiry process that will lead to a richer experience for your reader.

So far, we have looked at structure and the ways it acts relatively directly to influence readers. However, structure doesn't have to be such a bang-you-on-the-head phenomenon. Structure can work in much more subtle ways, as well. And while we've practiced those subtle-yet-harsh methods of structure in our Class Map, we'll be exploring other ways that structure impacts the effect your writing can have through these next few pieces.
As you are reading, ask yourself what elements of structure are you seeing from the list below:



Macro-structure (alignments, fonts, page colors- ""whole-page"" or ""whole-document"" structural elements)
Paragraph-level structure (line breaks, ""white space,"" the ways sentences fit together)
Sentence structure (long or short, run-ons or fragments, grammatical choice, use of larger/smaller words, alliteration, etc.)
Micro-structure (below sentence level such as spelling choices, grammar choices, punctuation choices etc.)

Annotated Bibliographies can serve many purposes. They can be a guide for ongoing research. They can be a roadmap, acting as something of a journal of readings and your understandings of them and how they fit into a larger discussion that you can look back on as you move through a learning/writing process. They can serve as an indicator to your instructor as to where your thoughts are on a subject. They can even be a took for you to see what perspectives you have or have not included in your writing. And, as they are often used in college courses, they can serve to provide an indication as to your understanding of materials/formatting styles. 
However, in this course it will be doing something else beyond that. Our annotated bibliography will actually be an integral part of your reader experience, taking them on a hypertextual journey from one space to another, utilizing a form of writing technology to show your reader information they could not encounter with just orthography and then augmenting that with a paragraph briefly summarizing that resource, and then about the ways this experience relates to the ways you might utilize it in writing. In this annotated bibliography, your reader may find themselves moving from your favorite park in your home town to a scholarly reading on the power of language to create in-groups to an infographic about demographics in your home town to a meme about language use in your community- all of which will help to build a fuller understanding of the reality you'd like to construct for your audience and the stories you'd like to tell them.
Our annotated bibliography will follow us through this course from this point on, so make sure you save a copy to turn in here, as well as a copy to continue adding onto. I want you to think about the ways that these various sources can develop your stories and demonstrate that, rather than thinking of this as a single assignment.
I highly encourage the use of mla.org's style guide for this assignment, as well as software designed to assist in these types of projects such as Mendeley or Endnote.

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers. 
TASK
READ



University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection (Links to an external site.)

Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.


Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Keep your reflection 100 - 250 words

Tanisha Neely,Practice Draft: Re-Mix Essay,5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2022-02-25 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
As we have been discussing structure the last couple of weeks, we've talked about physical structure of the world and how it can be ""mapped"" by different rhetorical choices. We've talked about the ways that structure can communicate meaning within our writing, and different manners of using structure to develop our writing. Now, we're going to take the next step, and create a structure of writing you've probably never used before, and we're going to focus not just partly, but ENTIRELY on structure to do it.
A Braided Essay is often a term used to describe the type of essay that we're going to be writing. It is a type of writing that takes at least three different narratives, often told in different genres, and weaves them together- alternately telling one, then the other, then the other. And when these narratives are told together, they make up a brand new narrative. Some of my favorite writing that I've done in the past is similar to the braided essay (though I have often kept it to weaving two stories narratives together rather than three), and some favorite cinematic fiction takes on this form, such as Love Actually or even Avengers use braided or parallel narratives. In fact, the entire MCU could be seen as one big braided essay, weaving together multiple stories to build a larger narrative arc. One of the most important factors- if not the most important factor- in these essays is how they are structured and not how each of these narratives are told, but when and in which chunks and ordering.
TASK
You are going to compose a ""Re-Mix"" of your work this semester so far, meaning you're going to take the work that you've already done, chop it up and put it back together again to form something new like a DJ sampling beats and hooks to create an entirely new song. 
You won't be doing any new writing for this piece. You may revise, if you would like. But you are not going to be doing any new drafting whatsoever. The entire focus of this project is on structure and how it can be used to create and recreate meaning.
The Re-Mix Essay must:



Be composed of short (1-2 paragraphs max) UNALTERED sections of previously-written texts rearranged to form a new piece
Be a minimum of three pages
Include a minimum of one piece of line poetry

Include a minimum of one piece of prose

Include a minimum of three total pieces

Include at least two citations included in previous works

As we begin to think about this idea of ""research,"" it is a good idea for us to first locate ourselves within the idea. As you have read in the overview for Unit 3, scholarly research can take on a much, much broader arena than you may have previously thought. You don't have to be a Stuffy Academic TM in a White Lab Coat TM to do research- research can help you in whatever field that you choose to go into, and can even help you in non-professional settings. 
Let's take a quick look at a couple ways of looking at research that could be useful to you if you're going into fields where you won't be that Stuffy Academic TM. Particularly, we're going to look at one video that gives an overview of Narrative Inquiry, and another one that looks at  Action Research. Both of these research stances could be useful to you in this unit, so make sure to pay attention!

What Is Action Research?

How does what I watched relate to things I've seen in the past or not?
How were my understandings of research challenged or upheld in these videos?
How might these ideas of research be useful to me in college, or after I leave college?
What types of research might I do in my eventual career, or my personal life, given my new understanding of it?
Who benefits from an understanding of research as inaccessible and exclusive?

We've been talking about research in class, but for you to really understand the ways that research can impact daily life, we need to see it. The Advocate, on its face, is a story about a man who gave up a life in academia to take up a life of action- of putting his lack of money where his mouth was and following a calling to do more. However, I would argue that Maurice Young actually never gave up academia. He just took it to its true potential. He never gave up research, he just brought it Home.
As we are rethinking research, I want you to do two things: First, I want you to think about what Maurice is doing and how research is an element of his work. What aspects of his advocacy (the action phas) would be impossible without first digging in, finding out, and learning? What parts of this movie (the reporting phase) would be impossible without that? Why did he choose this particular type of learning rather than another type? Second, I want you to think about yourself in relationship to Maurice's work. How does this relate to where you see yourself and the problems that you see yourself solving for your own Home?

As you've now learned through the Action Research viewing, in a research process there is ""reflection,"" then ""learning,"" then ""planning,"" then ""action"" and finally ""reflection"" again. These stages don't have to happen exactly in order, and undergo what's called a recursive or continually overlapping back over each other process... just like all writing processes!
One thing that often gets lost in several of the steps, however, is one of the most crucial aspects of doing effective research that can make a difference. Often, when researching, we become obsessed with a problem. That is, after all, what we're trying to solve. Why wouldn't we focus on that? However, one of the most important steps to solving a problem is identifying what you can do to solve it. And you can't solve a problem without certain tools, resources, people, institutions, etc. How would you solve homelessness without homes? Hunger without food? 
So for this reading, we're going to focus not on our problems, but on assets. There will be a video on something called asset mapping that will give you some perspective on what types of assets you should think of and if you take Action Research out into the world with you (which I encourage you to do, as it is a powerful problem-solving tool) ways to uncover those assets that might otherwise be invisible from your perspective but obvious from others' perspective. You'll then see an example of an asset-based organization doing great work in Indianapolis, the Kheprw Institute. Identify ways that they are identifying and utilizing assets to solve problems in Indianapolis. How can you use what they do as a model for solving the problems you want to solve in your own community?
Don't forget to think about assets as much as, if not more than, your problem when you are in your learning phase of research, and identify those assets in your writing to demonstrate to your reader that your solution is realistic!

As we learned in Unit 2, Annotated Bibliographies can serve many purposes. This time, they will be a way for you to allow the voices of others to help guide your writing. We are, for the first time in this course, expected to allow the voices of others to assist in a very real way in developing our thoughts and our arguments, and an annotated bibliography is one of the best ways for us to do that because it allows you to see your interpretation of those ideas in something like paragraph form in front of you. Therefore, the ""first draft"" of your research project will be in annotated bibliography form (MLA).
This particular annotated bibliography does not have to, and should not, be in alphabetical order. It is a way for you to design your research, so keeping them in alphabetical order like some annotated bibs ask you to do doesn't make all that much sense. I would encourage you to not forget our mapping metaphors that we've been talking about in the annotated bibliography for Unit 2. Though we are foregrounding others' words rather than physical places, that concept still applies. Think about where you are beginning- what does your audience need to know before you introduce the assets/problems? How can you take them from that introduction to the solution, and help them imagine a world where that solution is implemented? Your annotated bibliography can be seen as sort of Google Maps that takes your reader through a route that ends with them being convinced to get on board with solving this problem your way. And as we go along, we'll do some exercises to help you see that route more clearly, see where you've missed steps in the directions that you need to go back and find, and see where your voice can take the reader through this research.
I highly encourage the use of mla.org's interactive practice template for this assignment, as well as software designed to assist in these types of projects such as Mendeley or Endnote. Do not use easybib or another online citation generator. There are quality levels to these types of programs- their algorithms can be more or less accurate, and most of the common ones are quite literally wrong more than they're right.

You have now created a draft of your research paper. And, as we've discussed before in this class, writing is not simply the act of putting something down on paper... that's drafting. Writing is just as much, if not more, reading your own work with a critical eye, getting the input of others, and revising and re-envisioning that work with a keener eye on your purpose and audience, as well as the myriad ways you can achieve that purpose for that audience. 
However, as novice writers you are likely not all that familiar with that process. While professional writers spend up to 90% of their time in the revision stage, novice writers tend to only go through 1 or 2 drafts. So, one of the things that we are going to do is help you to create a revision plan, or a template for how you can undergo the revision process as you move forward. 
The revision plan template is very simple, and it may look very familiar to you. It is similar, of course, to the Peer Review form that you've completed each time we've been moving into the Portfolio phase of a unit. That's because I'd like to direct your eye to some of those same places-- not to things like punctuation and nit-picky little things, but how effectively am I bringing an idea to an audience that I understand with a chance to move them toward some action. What is that idea, and how can I sharpen it? Who is that audience, and how can I understand and speak to them in a way they will value? What is my purpose, and how can I move my audience toward it?
These are the questions of revision, and they bring in some of our big ideas from the rest of this semester:

Language varieties/Discourses
Structures

As we are working on our research writing and discussions of research, I don't want us to lose sight of the work that we've been doing all semester with focusing on really critical things like home and specificity and structure and language choices. For that reason, while we're working on your research project, we will also be beginning to read a novel by Maurice Broaddus with a strong theme of home, especially for characters who are, objectively, very far from the place that they have always called home. 
This reading will be sort of a model text for us. We will look at the ways that Broaddus uses his characters and their relationships to explore these concepts of home, we will see the ways he utilizes specificity, structure and language in this exploration.

Tanisha Neely,CLASS READING 11/5,,0,0,,"PURPOSE
As we are working on our research writing and discussions of research, I don't want us to lose sight of the work that we've been doing all semester with focusing on really critical things like home and specificity and structure and language choices. For that reason, while we're working on your research project, we will also be beginning to read a novel by Maurice Broaddus with a strong theme of home, especially for characters who are, objectively, very far from the place that they have always called home. 
This reading will be sort of a model text for us. We will look at the ways that Broaddus uses his characters and their relationships to explore these concepts of home, we will see the ways he utilizes specificity, structure and language in this exploration. And we'll see the ways that he employs distinct rhetorical choices to accomplish various purposes within the text, and occasionally take some time to sit back, take a break from the hustle and bustle, and just discuss our reading and how it relates to our discussions of our writing.

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the week. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week? What do you think was the ""big idea"" of the week now that it's in the rearview mirror?
Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers. 
TASK
READ



University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection (Links to an external site.)

Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.




Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?

What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Keep your reflection 100 - 250 words

We have been working through this research assignment for two weeks now, and it has become time for it to take shape. You have been working either in opposition to or directly from a problem that you stated you wished to solve in your Writing Assessment Essay, and have been through a Reflection process, including a revision plan. You have been through a Learning process, including creating an annotated bibliography to help you identify gaps in your research and provide a framework upon which it could proceed. Now, it is time to add your voice back into the process, and create a complete draft of your project, which is a form of the planning process. 
Like all research, we have to provide some framework for it to exist. And for this, we are going to go with the standard ""academic"" framework for your piece. You can make determinations about the audience for this piece, but I want at least part of your audience to be an academic one. If you believe that a better audience to help you solve your problem would be a popular one, don't worry- there will be time for that piece in your Final Portfolio, as well.
TASK
You will create a minimum four-page research paper that will adhere to the following guidelines:



The writing must seek to introduce, and then provide some at least partial solution to, a problem that you see in your ""home.""
The writing must include reference to ""assets"" that this community has, and seek to utilize them within the solution
The writing must include references to ""needs"" that this community has and how they relate to the problem/solution
The writing must demonstrate the ways that you will be involved in implementing this solution. This should be a realistic solution to a problem that you have the capacity to be a part of the change. And you can be a part of solving huge problems, if you can identify your role in solving them.
The writing must demonstrate the ways that research will be an ongoing component discovering and implementing a solution. See the Action Research and/or Narrative Inquiry videos earlier for guides on what these research processes can look like, and ""The Advocate"" for a model on what this can look like in practice.
The writing must include a minimum of four citations in MLA format, following the guidelines below:


A minimum of one scholarly citation such as a journal article, book, or study

A minimum of one CREDIBLE popular citation such as a newspaper article, tweet, or other piece emerging from the community themselves
A possibility for primary resources such as interviews with community members, direct observations, etc.





The writing's format must adhere to the following guidelines:



Begin with an Introduction that will inform the reader of what types of information they are about to read, characterizes the community and their assets/needs, etc.
Include a discussion of the problem that identifies the problem itself and how it manifests within the community. This should include citations that help the reader to understand the problem and its context.
Include a discussion of the solution that identifies the actions the author will take, personally and communally, to help to resolve the problem, how you are involved, and how research can play an ongoing role in the solution.
End with a conclusion that wraps up the big ideas and helps the reader to understand the totality of the writing
Be in MLA format

This model helps you to learn in ways that will allow you to take the lessons we learn this unit and use them in other places. How? Well, that will be up to the lesson and what you are able to take form it. 
TASK
I want you to first look backward through each of your previous preflections and reflections, the assignments you've completed, and all of the work you've done so far this semester. This unit, as you know from the introduction, will be different. We'll be taking that work that we've done and then developing it into something that we can be proud of, something that represents all of that work in writing as a Final Portfolio. That means that everything you've learned so far this semester is integral to how you can develop that portfolio.
Then, given what you've seen and how you've seen yourself developing throughout this class as a writer and student and individual within our community of writers, think ahead to this unit. What do you see for yourself in the next four weeks? What types of work that you've learned how to engage in will you utilize most heavily? What actions will you take? What lessons will you implement? Then, dive into the preflection.
In a max of 100 words and minimum of 250 words, answer the simple questions below in either a spoken (video) or written format:



What assignments or readings do I see that I am excited about? Less excited about?
Do these assignments remind me of any that I've had in the past? Why or why not? 
What do I expect that I'll learn from these readings, assignments and in class?
What actions can I take to be an effective learning as we move through these activities? 



There are no expectations of grammar, fluency or other concerns that you may wish to stress on. Rather, I simply want to see your thinking on paper. Do not spend a huge amount of time on this- I highly prefer that you do this all in one sitting so I can see your thoughts happening as they are coming to you.

We don't get a second chance to make first impressions in person, and the same goes for writing. Opening sentences and page 1's are where authors throw it all on the page, setting the stage for what will come in the next dozens or hundreds of pages. They're short on story and big on setting, character, powerful word choice and evocative imagery. They, often, are meant not to begin telling the story itself, but bring the reader into the mood of the story. From ""Call me Ischmael"" to ""Mother died today"" to ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times..."" even opening lines have been given elevated status in literary history. Who, after all, after having read Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God doesn't remember ""Ships at a distance have every man's wish on board."" Does it introduce us to the story? No. History? No. Character? No. But does it evoke something true and emotional and raw in us? Does it build a mood? Absolutely. That's what you'll be doing for YOUR page 1.
This project is meant to build DIRECTLY from your ""I Am From"" piece. You should select pieces of your ""I Am From"" that you believe will allow you to tell a story that in some way matters either to you or someone else (it can be fiction, but a non-fiction story might work better, especially one that relates somehow to language, culture, or your home!) and continue to develop them into prose, expanding upon them and adding more and more detail until you get to a minimum of one full page, double-spaced.

WRITE


My Page 1.



In a minumum of one page (but don't go more than a few sentence over!), you will bring your reader into a world that you occupy. Your task is not to introduce your reader to you, but to build a mood, set a scene, and stir emotions while nothing in particular is happening necessarily. No plot. No stories. No movement. Just setting the table for your reader through sensory description and perhaps dialogue. Then, in the final sentence or two, introduce yourself as a character in some way.
Tools to aid you:
Description:

Sensory information- try to get all five senses involved!

What kind of lighting? Where is the light coming from? Is it reflecting off anything or distorted in any way? Lighting often is a very predominant indicator of mood. Bright sun can be oppressive or warming, a cloudy day can be like a comforting blanket or foreboding.
What kind of sounds? Crickets, or factories, or traffic, or waves? Where are they coming from? Do they seem pure or distorted or filtered? Sound is often an indicator of how someone is interacting with their environment or their feelings of being at home. We've all been in a place where the sounds are new and it's a bit disconcerting, and we've all become accustomed to sounds in our homes that otherwise might be disconcerting.
What does this world feel like on your skin? Lips? What does your hair feel like? This sensory input is also very akin to their comfort and emotional state, something your reader can easily interpret through this sensory description.
What does this world taste like? Tastes are often indicators of places that we just were. Right now, I'm at a conference, and I can still taste the latte that I drank on the drive here- a common indicator that somebody is going to be diving into their day early in the morning- something your reader will almost definitely interpret from simply saying the taste of coffee was fresh on your character's tongue.
What does this world smell like? Smell is our most common connector to memory, even more so than sight, and as such can have a very potent connection to the emotions you can impart upon your reader.



Rhetorical Devices



Metaphor: Introducing a situation that is a metaphor for how you interact with the world, such as the hope embodied in ships approaching the harbor
Foreshadowing: Talking about something that will happen to your character. ""He didn't know that he would be up late that night, but that outcome was already determined.""
Dramatic Irony: Introducing some reality that your character will not or does not know about. ""The familiar face approaching around the broken-bricked corner of the building that was, twenty years ago, the dime store and still bore its name on the rotting wooden sign, was a familiar one. But no one in the square knew that yet. No one in the square knew a face approached at all. They laughed as if today was simply another day in their lives that they would log away like all the others...""
Something similar to dramatic irony that I call reverse-substantiation- providing evidence to support the conclusion that your character will draw very soon: ""The vial had turned bright red, a stark contrast from the deep blue of the reagent introduced in the early morning, the last time anyone had occupied this room. Test results happen that way- they become conclusive long before anyone is there to conclude anything at all."" OR ""Denny and Nordloff in 2019 concluded in their research that students from low-income families were being left out of the current writing centers paradigm. Victoria Purcell-Gates, all the way back in the 90's, found that students with a history of family illiteracy in Appalachia were victims of unrecognized linguistic discrimination by faculty as early as elementary. But still, one expects classrooms to feel welcoming- safe- sometimes despite a lifetime of experience to the contrary.""



Language



Which variety of English is going to most effectively bring your reader into your world? Is it that of ""academia,"" or is it the one that you hear and are familiar with in your home, in your neighborhood, in your specific interest, in your region? Would it be ""Each of these individuals is ill equipped for the challenge"" or ""y'all dunno da hell ya'll doin!"" BOTH CAN BE IMPACTFUL CHOICES- YOU SHOULD MAKE THIS CHOICE BASED ON IF THIS IS AN ACADEMIC AUDIENCE OR ONE OUTSIDE ACADEMIA

Do you have multiple Englishes to draw upon that you can integrate? Do you have languages beyond English that you can draw on that will help to set the scene, even for readers of English? Does it most matter if your reader understands the words themselves or the feelings they evoke? You are highly encouraged to incorporate your other languages into this piece!

So, here's the thing. You may have expected, in this writing course, to only be working with the black-on-white text that we call ""orthography."" But the reality is that we're going to be focusing much more broadly than that, and the field of writing encapsulates so, so much more than orthography. Let's say that you're creating a podcast, and you're telling a story. How are you going to plan out what you're going to say? You could of course do it on the fly, or think about it and try and memorize what you were going to say without putting it down anywhere. All of these things would've been what happened before the definition of writing, if you were going to record an anachronistic podcast. But far, far more likely for any scripted podcast or even a podcast that involves some basic level of planning is that you will utilize the technology that we call writing to facilitate the creation of the podcast.
You see, writing itself isn't a single thing, much the way that ""home"" isn't a single thing. It is a technology that facilitates our ability to effectively navigate LOTS AND LOTS of contexts. And any time that navigating the world can be more effective by placing something physically onto paper or metaphorically onto ""paper"" in a digital space, THAT is writing. 
One of the ways that we can communicate that can only tangentially be called writing is the use of images- and yet, it can absolutely be called writing in certain contexts. We're going to explore one of those contexts for this assignment- how can you effectively communicate who you are and what you call your ""home"" without including yourself or photos of others (as the focus),  and without orthographic text? I and your classmates will discuss the story that these photos, in their totality, including the way you arrange them on the page etc., can and do communicate to others, and if it is in line with your intended story. What do you think effects the stories that are being told? Why do these images communicate these things?
Think about objects/things that might connect to what you've already written about in your I Am From or your My Page 1! That will really help you to develop your ""Home That Built Me"" essay later!
TASK
You are going to allow objects, spaces and other things/places around you to speak for themselves when communicating who you are and what you call your home. You will create, using at minimum three photographs, some type of message that is meant to tell us about you and what you call home. There will be no people in these photos unless they're immaterial to the photo itself (like people playing in the park, but the park itself is the focus). You'll be sharing at least three photographs of:



One object. This is something of value to you that is self-contained, meaning it has some kind of boundary thats purpose is not to hold other things. It could be something like a shoe or a television or a ceramic statue of a toad performing brain surgery on a squirrel. Whatever you're feeling. Get creative. 
One space. This is an area bounded by some type of markers, be they geographic, physical, social, or other. This could be a room, a yard, a park, a hallway, a locker, etc. The purpose of these things is to be boundaries where certain types of activities occur. You wouldn't eat soup in the bathroom or do your taxes on the front lawn, for instance, but there are other things you would do there.
One other. This can be anything (appropriate for class) that tells us something about who you are, as long as there are no people included. 



There will be no orthographic text whatsoever allowed for this project.

We've been talking in class a lot about ""showing vs telling"" and the power of description. We've seen the ways that a simple photograph can ""construct an identity"" for the ""speaker"" as we refer to it in the discipline- ""tell people something about you"" in layman's terms. Now we're going to work on putting those things into writing in a format that is designed explicitly to help you construct an identity with vivid ""showing"" detail. The ""I Am From"" poem takes out the guess-work of structure and the ""what do I write about?"" and helps you to focus entirely on these things. What do I want my reader to interpret about me? What details can I include to give them this impression? How specific can I/should I be? It's a great opportunity to practice these skills in a way that we're going to be utilizing throughout this class.
TASK
Using the ""I Am From"" format found at the bottom of this poem, construct your own ""I Am From"" poem. The poem should:



Focus on what identity you would like to construct for your reader
Utilize highly detailed and specific sensory information to ""show"" this identity
Speak from the first person perspective
Utilize an English that evokes the identity that you wish to construct for your reader
Follow the format provided by the ""I Am From"" poem template (you will have the opportunity to alter it later if you'd like)

Tanisha Neely,Weekly Reflection,0.0,0,0,2022-08-29 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

Reflection, and especially quiet, contemplative, reflective writing, can be a powerful tool both for learning and any kind of self-exploration and growth if you give yourself a moment for it- and in this class, we will be practicing this skill and harnessing its benefits to help you develop your identity as writers. 
TASK
READ



University of Waterloo, Critical Reflection

Your Weekly Preview (from Monday of this week)



WRITE
Your writing should follow the ""What/So What/What Now"" model seen in the reading above. In your reflection, you may answer questions such as:



What were your expectations for the week that you expressed in your Preflection (write them down, don't assume I'll just go back and read them)? How were your expectations upheld? Undermined? What did you learn that you expected/defied your expectations? Why are these things important to the growth of your identity as a writer, do you think? These are examples of what/so what questions. Feel free to formulate your own.




Question you MUST answer:



What is a situation in my ongoing education I can imagine in the future where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me?
What is a situation outside of my formal education where this new knowledge/way of knowing could be useful to me? 



Your reflection must:



Look back at and make references to class readings, class discussion, or writing you've done to support what you say.
Keep your reflection 100 - 250 words



OBJECTIVES



Substantiate ideas and statements to accomplish a purpose
Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives
Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion
Respond critically to readings and writers
Uses appropriate Englishes for rhetorical purposes

Draft 2,5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2020-08-25 01:01:01.000001,"Now that you've had an opportunity to work on your I Am From... poems a couple times in class, it's time to submit your second draft. If you don't think it's perfect yet, that's fine. No writing is ever perfect. And besides, we will come back to these."
Tanisha Neely,Strange Angels Draft 1,5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2022-02-23 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
In our lives, there are times where we come upon someone for just an instant who has a huge impact on us, and then they disappear never to return. Likely, they don't even know the kind of impact they had on us, and never will. They likely never learned our name, and we never learned theirs. They may never think about us again. But we think about them often.
These people are often called ""Strange Angels,"" or people who, while their time with us was brief, their impact lingers. For this assignment, you will be writing a prose-like poem that tells the story of a strange angel
Contrasting with our Ode, which has a relatively rigid structure, this poem is designed to have a very loose structure much like the prose poems by myself and David Shumate. How do you think this might effect the ways that your reader can navigate the poem? The feelings that it engenders? How can you ensure that this is a prose poem rather than a brief letter or reflection? What structural or linguistic elements do you see in David's and my poetry that make it a poem rather than a short essay?
Beyond that loose mandate, the poem can read like a letter to the person, an internal reflection upon the ways they have changed your life, a piece to your future or present children about the ways small actions can have large effects, or many other things. The primary thing that I want you to focus on is the ways that the prose-like structure effects the readability in contrast to your Ode to an Intersection. 
TASK
Tell your audience the story of a ""Strange Angel"" from your life in a prose poem using strong nouns and verbs and descriptive language. Your poem should:



Be less than 3/4 of a page of prose poetry
Describe a very brief encounter, preferably one that can be measured in seconds
Focus on someone who you do not know intimately. Your mom is a regular angel, not a strange angel
Speculate on what is happening in their mind, as well as yours
Use vivid description including all five senses

Tanisha Neely,Ode to an Intersection Draft 1,5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2022-02-23 01:01:01.000001,"PURPOSE
In our exploration of the ways rhetorical decisions can have real-world impacts, we are going to begin working with two types of poetry which look to unite these ideas of space, description and structure. One of these genres is the Ode. Throughout the ages, poets have written odes to things of beauty. ""Ode to a Grecian Urn"" by John Keats is one of the most famous, as is ""Ode to the West Wind"" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. Odes can take many different forms, but share some qualities.

They speak directly to the subject of the poem, often something unable to speak or even understand, as a way to tell others of its greatness and communicate something larger about the world
They are line poems that incorporate regular line breaks
They are medium-long. These are not ten-line poems, but they're not T.S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" either.

While the language of the poets I've shared odes from above, from the middle of the 19th Century Romantic period, is very flowery and obtuse, I'd like you to write your ode in plain Englishes- whatever Englishes you expect that your chosen intersection would like to hear in an ode to itself. I know that my intersection- where the quiet entrance to my neighborhood exits onto the busiest road in my whole town- wouldn't want me to talk in some kind of academic-speak. It would feel talked down to, and it doesn't deserve that- also, it might just beat me up because as it looks now it's pretty neat, but it's definitely got a rough past. Instead I'd prolly have to talk like the people around it to avoid Discourse Tension and consequences that could damage our relationship.
TASK
Compose an Ode to an Intersection- and yes, I mean that literally. This ode should be dedicated to a literal intersection. Your ode should:



Be dedicated to a literal intersection
Be a minimum of one page
Be a line poem with regular line breaks
Include significant sensory description from all five senses

Seeks some type of larger conversation beyond simply appreciating this intersection

For this end-of-unit reflection, we'll be doing the same exercise that we do every week. There are only 3 differences:

This reflection will be over the entire unit rather than a single week
This reflection will be a bit longer- about twice as long
A cleaned-up version of this reflection (modified to act as a bookend to your Artist's Statement) will appear at the very end of your Portfolio. 

As a reminder, we are using a learning model in this course that asks that you ""Preflect, Attend, Reflect. This, now, is the time where you reflect. This requires that you spend a moment looking back at your work for the last few weeks. Find a quiet place where you can easily think. Take a few deep breaths, and try to place yourself back into the shoes of your former self, and start from the beginning, at your Preflection, and work through the readings, class discussions/exercises, and writing that you've done this week. Does anything stand out to you now that didn't in the moment? Are you making any connections that you didn't at the start of the week?

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the best possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task- include all of the things I ask from you, and while showcasing each individual piece, also feel like a single, cohesive piece of art. You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:

First: An Artist's Statement of at least 100 words (see link for help in creating artist's statement)


Last: A 250-word reflective synopsis of what you've learned in this unit, including quotations and examples from your texts as demonstrations of that learning (for instance a quote from an original version followed by how that section ended up). This can and should be built from your Unit 1 Reflection.

At any place between these two pieces- wherever it fits best:

Your Visual Identity Project
Your Class Visual Identity Project

A revised version of your ""My Page 1"" that seems to be the beginning of a larger piece to come.

A revised version of your ""I Am From..."" poem

A finalized version of your ""The Home That Built Me"" essay

GRADING CRITERIA
Your portfolio will be graded using this rubric
RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES



Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;

The assignment is to draft a one page description of your ""home."" This can be any place, group of people, environment (like a concert), type of conversation, brand of hair-tie... anything. But the key is that you are going to describe this home without directly telling us what it is or why this is ""home"" to you.

Tanisha Neely,The Naming Game,0.0,0,0,,"In class on 8/26/2020, we'll be playing a game to practice something called ""naming"" by writing scholars. It's the concept of calling things by not what they are often called, but what will bring about the intended understanding in the reader. For instance, we've all heard of the Shakespearean Insult Generator, right? Here are some of the Bard's most famous insults.
What do these insults have in common, besides being both hilarious and creative? Well, none of them are the common ways to refer to a person, and it's exactly their uncommonness and metaphorical connections that becomes so evocative and make such effective communication. 
Other iconic disses?
50 Cent: ""You a pop tart sweetheart, you soft in the middle/I eat you for breakfast""
Seriously not the same as: ""You ain't tough and I could beat you up""
Jay Z: ""So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was usin' it wrong/You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song""
Seriously not the same as: ""I used your line better than you did""LL Cool J: ""You can't handle the whole weight/Skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate/Wise up, you little burnt-up french fry/I'm that type of guy.""Seriously not the same as: ""You should really invest more time in self-care.""Now that we've seen some naming in play, we're going to play a game and divide into groups of 3. Each group of 3 is going to take a single phrase from a sample of writing volunteered by a classmate for all of us to utilize and focus on naming. All groups will get one minute to confer before offering up their name for votes. The team that wins the popular vote for best Name will get one bonus point- ties will be broken by the tied teams offering a new name after a 15 second runoff period, which will then be voted on by all teams not competing in the tiebreak. We'll re-run this competition until we run out of time."

We're going to be doing a Works Cited page- for your portion of the class map.
You can find the main MLA page here, and an introduction on how to cite a google earth location here. But more important than the citation itself, I want you to create an Annotation. An annotation is a brief description of your source and how it relates the the greater work that you are attempting to accomplish with your writing. Annotations can serve many purposes, but for this project I want you to focus on how, exactly, this location is like a second home to you and how it contributes to your sense of who you are.

Cite the location. You can see, above, guidelines for completing this portion of your task.
Begin your annotation by summarizing the location's key characteristics. Use the naming skill we've been talking about in class to create an effective description. You don't need to necessarily describe everything about it. But you do need to describe the things that are most important to your sense of home, and your sense of who you are.
After you have described the location, tell us why it is important that you included it as one of only a few places you've shared thus far in the class. How has this place shaped you? How might you have been different if this place had never entered your life? Why, in other words, is it important to who you are?

The only  rules for this assignment are that you should highlight each of the foci below and that you must time yourself as you are writing, only allowing yourself one five-minute break during 30 minutes of otherwise nonstop writing (even if you hate what you're getting down on paper, or it's just gibberish).
Write in the language that you speak with your friends from these ""home"" locations for 30 minutes on the subject of language and home. Your writing should hit on at least the following items: 

What places were important to me as I grew up and what communities were present there? (utilize your annotated bibliography and cite those places... if you bring up new places, you do not need to cite them now, but you will need to eventually cite them in MLA and add an annotation as well)
Think about how you speak when you are around those communities, drawing on your experience with your dialogues. What are some things about your actual spoken language that stand out to you?

Kinesics is the study of how we move our bodies when we interact in different communities. How are bodies, their position, their posturing, their contact or lack thereof, important in those communities?
Sociolinguists are keenly aware of the ways that language communicates in-group and out-group status. What are some ways that your language use (including things like what your clothing communicates, what beliefs or ideas will be accepted and which won't be, when you're allowed to challenge someone and when you aren't, or other ""unwritten rules"") in these groups helps people know you're a part of the group, even if you've just met?
How does your home community's language use (including all of that ""other stuff"" we've been mentioning above and/or is mentioned in the reading linked above) look to other people? How does it appear to ""academia,"" or the ""professional"" or ""scholarly"" world?
How do YOU feel about your home language, including all of those things? Do you communicate that way everywhere? Why or why not?

They should be a greeting and brief conversation about any topic, but there are a few requirements:

The first dialogue should be between you and someone you consider yourself most ""you"" around.  Your mother, a best friend, your partner, etc. It should be glaringly honest- maybe even something that has actually happened when you greeted each other. It should take place in a location where you are free to be yourselves, where you feel comfortable. This can include profanity of any variety if it's something that the two would actually say- and it should be written in the way you'd actually say it (something that holds true for the rest of these dialogues, as well). For instance, my best friend and I might greet each other and have a brief, candid conversation like so:""Hey dude, what's up.""""Hey bro. Thanks for callin' me out yesterday.""""Wha?""""When we were in the car with my dad, and you gave me that look. That, like, 'you're effin' lyin'' look?""""OOOOOHHHH HELL. You think he noticed?""""Nah... He was driving. Also, he'on know what he's even doin', let alone anyone else.""""Loll""

The second dialogue should be between yourself and a random acquaintance- someone that you know, but don't know well at all- that you run into randomly in a public location like a grocery store or a concert. You feel as if you need to speak to them, but you're not nearly as comfortable with them as with your friend. How does your language use differ in this situation?

The final dialogue should be between you and a stranger whose opinion you highly value. Since we're on a Catholic campus, the example I often use is the Pope. However, this can be any highly respected and influential figure that you might feel somewhat in awe of getting to meet. Again, how does your language use differ in this situation?

 
Come to class prepared to share a little bit about these dialogues, and how they relate to ""home"" for you."

This piece will be worked into some of the things we've been doing in class, as well as your Unit 2 Portfolio. 

Whose values influenced the ways you view language, writing, and all of the things we've talked about that are wrapped up in it as that ""other stuff""?
What places do you call home that have influenced your linguistic identity? How have they done so?
How does your language relate to how you see yourself and your ""home"" and community/communities, and how you believe others see you, your ""home"" and your community/communities?
Overall, why do you interact with language/writing the way you do, and what forces do you think influence that?

A portfolio is meant to be an opportunity to showcase exactly what you've accomplished throughout some period, whether it be a couple of weeks like in this course, or over a lifetime like a Tenure Portfolio. For this purpose, you should work to bring your work to the best possible place, and utilize your artist's statement and end-of-portfolio reflection to contextualize it for the greatest effect upon the reader. Think about it as a sandwich- the best possible ingredients in the middle that together meld into one beautiful flavor, and two pieces on either side that serve to bring it all together and make sure it remains cohesive for the reader. 
Your portfolio can look like a wide range of things, as long as it fulfills its basic task- include all of the things I ask from you, and while showcasing each individual piece, also feel like a single, cohesive piece of art. You can use power point. You can use a single word document. You can create a portfolio website on Wix or another free site. Whatever you feel will best showcase your work. Just be sure to include all of it, and make it easy for me to navigate!
TASK
Create a portfolio of your work that includes:

At the front of the portfolio, an Artist's Statement of at least 100 words
At the end, a reflection of at least 100 words (can be very similar to your end of unit reflection)

At any place that fits best, a newly revised version of a piece from your Unit 1 Portfolio
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Ode to an Intersection""
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Strange Angels""
At any place that fits best, your best revised version of your ""Re-Mix""

When we introduced the Preflection concept, we briefly discussed some basic learning theory. As a brief reminder, learning is a more complex process than looking at something or doing something. You must first retain knowledge, but then also be able to undergo a process called transfer that allows that knowledge to be useful in new scenarios. One of the best, evidence-based practices for ensuring that writers learn from their work is to put in lots of practice, and augment that practice with a ""preview, attend, review, study, access"" format. The Weekly Reflections you will complete in this class make up the third portion of that recursive, five-part process.
In particular, for this class we will be doing a specific type of ""review"" called ""critical reflection."" You likely know the word ""reflection."" It means exactly what you probably think it means- looking back at how you view things through writing and just kind of putting it down on paper to aid both your thinking and me in understanding your thinking. But what about that other word, ""critical""? What does that mean?
A ""Critical Reflection"" adds an additional element of internal/external scrutiny. It seeks to make connections between the internal and external, experience and events, causes and effects. It seeks to not only record, but dive into and attempt to understand what has occurred. And, even more importantly, it seeks to recognize realities that were previously hidden and determine whether these realities are helpful or harmful or benign, and chart a path that will be more positive than the previous path. In essence, a critical reflection seeks to place a growth mindset upon the reflective stance, both personally/individually and socially/collectively. What has occurred, how/why did it come about, and how can I continue to do better in the future?
I encourage you to think on paper for these reflections. They do not need to be pretty- they need to be intentional. This is the time for you to do the work of understanding yourself/your coursework, and charting a course ahead. That is never pretty work, but it is important work. This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is mono-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help everyone grow- you in your understanding of yourself, your environment, your thinking and your writing, and me in my understanding of how to support you,-not to turn out a ""quality"" product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one (in the sense of requiring depth and intentionality), and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur.

Form a ""Why"" question. This is a moment for you to interrogate your own words. Why did you respond this way? What values do you have that lead you to think this way, and are there other valid sets of values or thoughts that others could have, and why might they value or think differently?

I want to offer you a road map toward critical reflection, the process of answering not only the question in front of you, but the unasked questions that lurk behind it. To looking not only at yourself as you are, unexamined and unquestioned, but what alternative versions of yourself might look like in a different set of shoes.

Tanisha Neely,Due 10/26: Class Sharing Assignment about Research on Community Solutions,7.0,0.008620689655172414,0.0,2020-10-26 01:01:01.000001,"Introduction
In class this semester, we've gone through two phases and will be entering a final one. The first two we've talked about. They are: 

Complicating/searching for ""home""
Problematizing the home/language interrelationship

I've also talked a little bit about what we're going to be doing in this unit, Unit 3, which will be moving toward solutions. And let's be honest... these are huge problems that we're up against. Every single problem that we've talked about in class is deep-seeded with thick, interconnected roots that cling to bedrock. But as James Baldwin said, ""Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced."" So, we're going to be facing these challenges head-on and looking at ways that we can begin to develop solutions.
Because, really, we had a preview of all of this in weeks 1 and 2. We talked about Desmond's complicated relationship with ""Home"" and talked about who we are in our Page 1, and looked at the Smithsonian's article on the origins of home and how they're a bit more complex than we may have previously thought. Then, we talked about the ways that not only is there a problem with the 4th Amendment (people without a physical space of ""home""... not aligning with our growing definition... are not protected by our founding document) but that this writing actively constructs our experience of the world and decides how individuals can be invited in or shut out in various ways based on wording, definitions, naming conventions etc.1  Then, we were all invited to take part in actively constructing our own classroom experience by proposing Amendments to the Syllabus- our founding document. In essence, you were using writing to create a solution to problems you identified in our classroom community.
And it's not just you guys. All around the world, people are utilizing language and writing as a means to ""write the world"" that they wish to live in. We've seen it based on the people who've been players in our classroom experience so far. From Maurice Broaddus' Afrofuturism to Maurice Young's Homeless Bill of Rights to Wildstyle Paschall's scathing historical review of The Ethnic Cleansing of Indiana Avenue, we've seen three incredible Black men fighting for the world they wish to see through writing and research. And now, we're going to focus in on the Near Northwest, and see more people utilizing language and writing and communicative arts and research to do powerful things within our community. Because Unit 3, as you've heard many times, is about solutions.
In this assignment, you're going to be investigating the how of arriving at solutions by taking a look at, and presenting about, one community organization that is utilizing writing, language, communication or research practices of some variety to write the world they wish to live in.
Content
There are a surprising number of organizations working toward different iterations of the future they wish to write in the Near Northwest of Indianapolis. Below, you will find a small sampling of them. 

The organization that Wildstyle Paschall is a member of, The Learning Tree and the immense amounts of projects that they oversee and take part in within the Near Northwest.
The organization that Maurice Broaddus is a part of, the Kheprw Institute (pronounced Keppra). They are located on the Near East Side but do a lot of work in the Near Northwest.

The Near Northwest is a ""Quality of Life"" organization comprised of neighbors and stakeholders (people who work or own in the area) working toward solutions in a variety of areas from Food Access (my area) to Housing to Community Safety to Parks and Public Spaces.

Flanner House is the oldest wrap-around services organization in the country, with its founding all the way back in the 1890's. Its genesis was during the era when Black residents could not get home loans or contractor's licenses or any number of types of access, so Black residents banded together to do things like build each other's homes and watch each other's children while they were working, grow and maintain food spaces, etc. They boast one of the oldest daycares in the nation as well, and a 1.4 acre farm within 2 miles of Downtown. They were one of the organizations booted off of Indiana Avenue by IUPUI in the 70's to their location where they reside today.

The Center for Leadership Development is a community organization dedicated to helping students from areas with low graduation rates get to and through college, among dozens of other ventures. They are located right across the street from Flanner House on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street.

Groundwork Indy is an organization dedicated to ecological education for residents of the Near Northwest, focusing on students between the ages of 15 and 18. They have their hands in an uncanny amount of ecologically-related initiatives around the Near Northwest, and regularly host writing-related workshops on their site off of Burdsal Avenue. 

 
What You Will Submit Here
Prior to class at 11 AM on 10/23 please submit a text on which you'll be basing your brief class presentation. This text will need to address:

What You Will Contribute to Class
For your contribution to class on Friday, 10/23, you will provide a 2 minute introduction to one specific program from the organization you've chosen. This introduction should address the following:

What is your organization and the name of the program/initiative
Where is this organization located and where does the initiative focus
What is the problem this initiative is meant to address
How does this initiative address the problem

Please rehearse at least once prior to delivery to make sure you stay within the time frame. 
Footnotes:
1. Bad news about the 4th Amendment, btw. My legal scholar friends have told me that because of centuries of legal precedent wearing away at it including rulings on the Patriot Act and a really interesting case involving a bugged phone booth where federal agents got around needing a warrant by placing the microphone on the outside of the booth but within their capacity to hear both parties in a conversation within it, the 4th Amendment is, as several of them quoted directly ""a legal fiction"" and agents of the state can essentially gather information on you or break into your home and do whatever whenever as long as it is considered ""reasonable"" by a very, very loose standard established in precedent. Hooray..."

On Friday, 10/23, you provided a brief presentation about a community organization within the Near Northwest Area that is looking to solve a specific problem(s). Then, on Monday, 10/26, you created your first draft bringing this conversation into writing. Now, I want you to undertake the process of re-envisioning you work. Remember the elements that we've been talking about in writing:

Naming
Show/Tell
Structure
Purpose
Audience

Begin to envision how these rhetorical choices can build your piece into something that fulfills its purpose of informing the reader about these initiatives, as well as whatever other purpose you want the writing to undertake.

What You Will Submit
Your second draft does not have to be a completed document, but it should begin the process of risk-taking to help a document find itself. What is this piece? Is it a collaborative effort between image and text to convey a feeling of this event? Is it a news article meant to provide information so others can get involved? Is it a manifesto about the strength of a group of people that incorporates audio of their voices to showcase them and be about them? A reader should begin to see the soul of the document developing in this second draft.
Missteps are okay, and even encouraged in this stage. You still have an entire draft left to turn in, and there is no penalty for doing something that doesn't quite pan out! Try some stuff! Get wild! See what you can get away with! Boldness will be rewarded."

What values do you have that lead you to think this way, and are there other valid sets of values or thoughts that others could have, and why might they value or think differently? Don't ask the question in your response-- just answer it in two or three final sentences.

I know that this can be confusing. I've been wordy here, but that's on purpose. The purpose, here, is to make you think hard. I don't want this to be an easy, throw-away assignment. I want you to have to look inside of yourself and earn your words. I want to offer you a road map toward critical reflection, the process of answering not only the question in front of you, but the unasked questions that lurk behind it. To looking not only at yourself as you are, unexamined and unquestioned, but what alternative versions of yourself might look like in a different set of shoes. Not only looking at the world as it is, but an alternate world that could be and whom that world might benefit that this one does not.If you have questions, I'm more than happy to guide you through this process. Let my responses to your first critical reflections guide you-- I tried to use them to push you forward in your responses.
This is an example of ""Writing to Learn."" Writing can have many types and purposes, and most likely you are familiar with one type-- transactional writing. Transactional writing means that I ask you to do a kind of writing, and you return that kind of writing for no one's benefit in particular but information transfer to the reader. It is one-directional, and it has a clear beginning and end. Writing to learn, however, is multi-directional, reciprocal, and has no clear beginning or end. Its entire purpose is to help you grow, not to turn out a product. If the writing itself is trash, but you learned a lot from it, you have successfully written to learn... if you use that new learning to develop new strategies for writing to learn, and continue to use it as a method of growth. That's why I want this assignment to be something of a difficult one, and I want all of your critical reflections to feel difficult, but positive. Growth takes discomfort, pushing yourself, and moving past your previous boundaries. And writing is a fantastic medium to help that occur."
Tanisha Neely,Unit 3 Reflection,5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2020-11-07 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
Throughout this unit we have worked with this concept of ""research."" We've delved into, first, how a process of action on the part of Maurice Young in the short documentary The Advocate could, in certain ways, be described as research in action. We then looked at that type of research, Action Research, among other types to demonstrate that research doesn't have to be all white lab coats and pipets or google searches and loneliness. It can be dynamic and curious and come with a punch of real-world action. And finally, we talked about three types of sources- Individual/anecdotal, communal/news, and conversational/scholarly- and spoke with Lynne Colbert from the Mother Theresa Hackelmeier Memorial Library about ways to leverage campus resources in our pursuit of those sources. And through it all we were putting in some writing time moving from research about homelessness to research about solutions within the Near Northwest, and, finally, the opportunity to think about how you're going to take what you know back to your home communities and make an impact on the ways language can help others in your community.
This reflection is an example of Writing to Learn. I don't care if it feels messy or if there are misspellings or things don't exactly seem to pan out. What I do want to see is you thinking deeply through text about the linguistic and research-based topics we've covered in this unit and how they relate back to this theme of ""home"" we've been exploring all semester. Below are some questions to help get you started.
Instructions
This reflection should be in paragraph form, not as a sequential answer to each question. The What/How/Why questions are designed to get you thinking, not to give you a series of three separate prompts. When you're answering each of these questions, your reflective writing should flow together into a unified paragraph.
Answer the questions ""What, How, and Why"" relating to this unit in a minimum of 250 words. To do this, follow these steps:

Form a ""What"" question. Do not write down your ""what"" question. Hold it in your mind. Examples are things like ""what was most valuable for me about this week, in class or something out of class that's related to writing or home?"" or ""What are any themes I'm noticing in class this week?"" or ""What is something that we didn't discuss this week that I wish we had""? Your writing should begin by answering that question in two or three sentences.
Form a ""How"" question that emerges from that original question. Do not write down you ""how"" question. Let it, and your response, emerge from the ""what"" question and answer it in writing as you continue to move down the page. If you are stuck and a ""how"" question doesn't come immediately to you while writing, reread your previous 2-3 sentences. Then ask yourself- what questions am I left with, as a reader, after reading my own words? This is your opportunity to analyze not only what is seen in the way you respond, but what is unseen? What might be or might have been left out of this conversation or unit, or the ways you've responded to it? What might someone who sees this situation entirely differently wonder about your statements? Your writing should continue by answer one or more of these questions in two or three sentences.
Form a ""Why"" question. Do not write down your ""what"" question. Let it, and your response, emerge from the writing you've already done as you progress down the page. This is a moment for you to interrogate your own words and focus on both introspection- why did I respond this way in this unit- and extrospection- why does the world set itself up this way, or why has this situation arisen? You should be asking yourself those critical questions of who is heard/unheard in my interpretation, who benefits/loses out from the way I'm seeing this unit, what ideological frames are given space/denied space? What values do you have that lead you to think this way, and are there other valid sets of values or thoughts that others could have, and why might they value or think differently? Don't write these questions in your response. Take 2-3 final sentences to answer one or more of those questions that come to mind as you wrap up your reflection.

Grading Criteria
Grades for reflections are completion grades. If you complete your 250 word reflection, you will receive full credit of 5. If you complete a reflection, but fail to meet the word count, you will receive either 2 or 3 points. If you do not complete your reflection by the due date, you will receive a 0. 
How To Submit
Type your reflection in the submission window and click ""Submit"" when you are satisfied with your response. You will see the number of words as you type in the submission box. "
Tanisha Neely,Writing Assignment Draft 1 Due 11/2: Problem/Solution in My Community (Draft 1),2.0,0.0024630541871921183,0.0,2020-11-03 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
This writing builds upon the previous two assignments you completed to move you from a place where you are reporting about events, to applying imaginative and analytic thinking to turn over the ways that what you've learned in this class can lead to a positive linguistic impact in your own community.
First, you have looked at different types of inquiry and examined the ins and outs of an extended movement for the betterment of a very specific group of people related to our theme of ""home."" Maurice Young took the time to understand and listen to people around him, and then took it upon himself to be a part of the solution, taking very specific tactics and taking part in very specific writing tasks (the Homeless Bill of Rights) to make change. This provided us a pattern- Learn, listen and understand; Plan and strategize; Take action; Analyze the effects of your action; Reflect on your action and the effects of your action; Learn, listen, and understand again as the process begins over. 
This pattern that Maurice Young took reflected a specific type of research that we looked at- Action Research. And so, we learned, that research can take many forms and doesn't have to be this intimidating thing done in white lab coats. We learned even more about research from Lynne Colbert, and then undertook your second research project in this unit, where you each looked up examples of particular initiatives related to language, learning and literacy happening right now or in the near past in your neighborhood of the Near Northwest. 
Hopefully, these examples of what research and action can look like have inspired you and provided an even greater template for the ways that you can make a difference on a language and/or literacy concern that you have for your community. You've been practicing what we've called ""proto-research"" and learning about the different types of problems that can manifest in language all semester, and now you've investigated what different types of solutions can look like. You are ready for this. You've already Learned, listened to writers from the NNW, and taken steps to understand language as it really exists, not as we tacitly understand it. Now, it's time to Plan and strategize.
Instructions
For this assignment, I want you to think about a language-related problem in one or more of the places that you call ""home."" This solution can be enacted now, as you are currently, or as some aspirational version of yourself when you've completed your degree 3.5ish years from now. As you are constructing your plan I want you to think about/do the following:

Analyze your own assets. What is your major, and how can it be applicable to language/literacy? What types of knowledge do you possess now or will you possess after completion of your degree? What are your aspirations for your life, and how can that be applicable? What traits, gifts, or other types of assets do you have available to you that you could mobilize?
How will you mobilize these assets? One asset you have gained over this semester is linguistic knowledge. What others can combine with that to build your solution?
Who is the group that can be supported by these assets? What assets are they likely to possess that can be mobilized? For example, if you hope to change the linguistic opinions and teaching of educators in your community, how can you leverage what they already do well to move them toward your goal?
What values do you and the group you hope to support share that you can call upon? Shared values and Discourse can be a powerful asset in creating change, as we have seen.
What tactics will you use to make the change? Conversations? Community-building? Pressure? Shame? Writing? Visuals? What will you do to reach this goal?
What will success look like for you? 
Most importantly, you can't do this yourself. What other types of people will you need on your team, and what types of assets will they bring toward your solution? 

Grading Criteria
This draft will be graded on completion. Like the rest of the writing faculty here, I believe in ""[crappy] first drafts."" That means this is an opportunity for you to take risks, just get your thoughts and possibilities and worries down on paper so that I can comment on them and you can read them and your peers can read them so that in draft 2, they can be sorted and re-imagined, and then refined for your final draft in Portfolio 3.
Take-aways
From this assignment, I want you to understand that you can make a difference. You are, as they say, capable of ""writing the world."" Your words matter, your thoughts matter, and your actions matter, and if you apply them you are capable of doing things, even small things, that will make the world a better place. This assignment is practice for that.
I want you to recognize that crazy ideas not only are okay, but are the way bold and beautiful things happen. There was a time, before linguistics, when no one thought about examining language at all. Someone had to think- ""you know what, I do this thing every day but have never taken the time to really think about it."" There was a time when no one had ever thought to use, not pictures, but abstract symbols relating to sounds, for the purposes of communication. Then, they had to teach other people how to use them. Both of those things, at the time of their invention, would have been absolutely bonkers ideas. But now they are the entire basis of your semester.
Don't be afraid of crazy ideas. Instead, learn, listen and understand; Plan and strategize; Take action; Analyze the effects of your action; Reflect on your action and the effects of your action; Learn, listen, and understand again as the process begins over. "
Tanisha Neely,Writing Assignment Draft 2 Due 11/4: Problem/Solution in My Community,2.0,0.0024630541871921183,0.0,2020-11-05 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
The purpose of creating a second draft, as with every second draft we have undergone in this class, is to have a chance to radically re-imagine your writing and the ways it can interact on the page with a reader. This is an opportunity to shift your focus from simply getting your thoughts down on paper to what effect does this have on a reader?
Since this draft is also a completion grade, it's another opportunity to take risks while thinking not about yourself and your thoughts, but your audience and theirs. What moves can you make that will influence a reader's understanding and experience of your writing? How can you utilize the type of writing that you are undertaking (aspirational research, in this case) to influence your writer's thinking and understand what your plans are and how they'll be impactful? To support your cause? To join your organization? Whatever your purpose for this aspirational research writing is. 
Instructions
I want you to radically rethink the ways that your writing can exist in relationship to your audience. To do that, we've investigated three key facets of written communication that you can leverage:

Show vs Tell: While research writing is a primarily telling genre, there will be key moments where showing can be very powerful for a reader. Think about what those moments might be for your writing and how you can do that to greatest effect.
Naming: While this type of writing (generally) won't incorporate super creative naming choices (unlike our conversation related to the Op-Ed style of writing discussed in your previous project), naming will still be a key facet of helping your reader develop meaning through your text. Look at the ways you use nouns and verbs, and ask if you can be stronger with your usage. Hunt down adverbs and adjectives to see if a stronger noun or verb could eliminate them. Give your reader the most evocative language appropriate for your purposes.
Structure: We have talked about two types- Sentence structure and Paragraph structure- as ways to use structure to build meaning in your writing. What are these types of structure saying in your writing? Do they make your content readable? Do they communicate the mood and tone of your writing to the reader? How am I using not just text, but white space on the page to my advantage? Can I use any non-text information such as breaks with separating items like asterisks or lines, or even images to my advantage? 

Grading Criteria
While this is a completion grade, when I score your Unit 3 Portfolio, as I've mentioned, there are 8 points assigned to Process. This means that while you won't be scored on the ways you revise your work here, you will eventually be graded on that, so it behooves you to look at your second and third drafts as an opportunity to work on developing your pieces. "
Tanisha Neely,Unit 3 Portfolio Draft Due 11/6,40.0,0.04926108374384237,0.0,2020-11-07 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
Like every other portfolio you've turned in in this class, the Unit 3 Portfolio is a chance for you to demonstrate the ways that you've applied what we've learned in class to your writing projects. As we've discussed many times in class, the measure of a writer is not how cleanly they can get words down on paper the first try, but the process by which they move from concept to polish. The best writers, in other words, are not those who can vomit most efficiently onto the page, but those who are the most tenacious, stick with it the longest, apply their learning, and come to a final product conscious and confident of its eventual impact on the audience.
This portfolio's intent is outlined in the course syllabus, and is meant to demonstrate your ability aligning with the following General Education Objectives:
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes;
And Course Outcomes:
a. Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
b. Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
c. Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
d. Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .
You have, throughout this unit, been asked to interpret meaning from different information mediums like text, audio, video and image, as well as a range of information presentation types from maps to articles to documentaries. You've been asked to communicate within a range of purposes, from informative research to inquiry to opinion to persuasion, all within the ""research"" genre. 
You have been asked to utilize various techniques discussed in class such as showing/telling, naming and structure, as well as a range of evidence strategies from emotional/logical to anecdotal to communal to scholarly. Your audiences have been both academic and non-academic, they have required multiple perspectives and critical inquiry into who benefits/is left out, who gets to speak/is silenced, and what ideologies are present/ignored. And, through your reflective writing, you've been asked to reflect on how these writings bear upon your ideas of research, language choices, writing, and our ever constant theme of ""home.""
We've been working on this all semester working up to the three assignments in this unit, and you are now prepared to demonstrate that learning through this Unit 3 Portfolio. 
Instructions
In a single document, you will combine the following writing projects
First- An Artist's Statement, designed to prepare your reader for what they will be reading. This should set me up to view the rest of your portfolio through the lens you'd like me to see it. Do you want me to see your growth as a writer? Do you want me to see the way you've really attacked ""naming"" as a strategy? Do you want me to see the contrast between the different types/genres of research writing you've undertaken? Set me up to read it that way not just with your words, but with good writing that utilizes the very strategies we've been talking about all semester from naming to showing vs. telling to meaning-making structure, and even references to the text if that will be helpful. 
Next- In whatever order you deem most appropriate for the way you'd like me to read your Unit 3 Portfolio:

Your submission to the Class Discussion Reflection Topic: What Can I Do?

Your final draft of the Homelessness Research Assignment
Your final draft of the What Are Our Communities Doing Assignment
Your final draft of the Problem/Solution in My Community Assignment


Last- Your Unit 3 Reflection. If you need to edit this for submission, you may. It should work as a bookend to your Artist's Statement, telling me not what should I expect but what learning did I just witness in these pages?  I should leave the final section of your portfolio feeling that I understand what growth you have undergone as a writer and thinker in these past few weeks, and why that growth is a valuable asset to you. 

Grading Criteria
There are 40 total points available for the Unit 3 Portfolio, broken up into 5 categories of 8 points each. These categories follow the values set forth by your instructor from the very beginning of the course.
8 Points for Process
 I should be able to look back at your Draft 1 of each of your works and see a concerted effort and movement in each of the pieces. Evidence that you've tried out new things and made significant effort to see where your writing can take you in developing your piece toward its final draft is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
8 Points for Rhetorical Effectiveness
I should be able to see the meaning that you are working toward, and see the ways that the choices you've made in writing are meant to lead your intended audience toward your purpose. This is the does your writing do what you want it to criteria. Evidence that your writing has a clear purpose, intended audience, and follows the expectations of that audience in ways that are beneficial to effectively ""moving"" them is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
8 Points for Structural Soundness
I should be able to see that you are intentionally utilizing structure as a meaning-making tool. While readability is absolutely a top-notch concern here, for full credit in this category I want to see that the sentence, paragraph, page etc. structure you've chosen is a conscious- not unconscious- method of ""moving"" your audience in line with your purpose.
8 Points for Linguistic Choice and Efficacy
This absolutely does not mean that you must use *Standard English in your writing. What it does mean is that the linguistic choices that you make- from Naming to Show vs Tell to the use of that ""other"" language in your writing like ands, buts, thoughs, howevers etc. are conscious- not unconscious- choices meant to ""move"" your audience in line with your purpose.
Response to Prompt
To receive full credit in this category, each piece must effectively respond to the prompt in its entirety. This does not always mean direclty answering every question in the prompt. It does, however, mean writing along the subject lines the prompt asks for, writing in the genre the prompt asks for, and following any guidelines set forth by the prompt. 
How to Submit
Submit your portfolio as a single document attachment with page breaks between each piece of writing you submit.
One final bit of advice: While you definitely want to let me know which piece in your portfolio is which, creating TITLES are a huge help toward building a full piece of writing! Titles are the first thing a reader sees when they open up your document, and ""Unit 3 Portfolio"" is not nearly as compelling or as effective at providing a reader an effective starting point as ""It's Alive: Research in the Real World through a College Freshman's Eyes"" and ""Homelessness Research Project"" is not as emotionally thwacking as ""When Your City Doesn't Want You"" or ""Solidarity Beneath Davidson Street."""
Tanisha Neely,Due before 11/9: Amendment for Vote (advocate for yourself with 2 weeks left),5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2020-11-14 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
Earlier in the year, you created an amendment meant to assist in ""writing your world"" in a way that will benefit you in this course. This demonstrated that writing is actually the means by which we build our experience. After all, our social contract is actually a written document. Your course syllabi which create the terms by which you experience your college experience are written documents. The student handbook that sets the terms by which you are able to experience your life on campus and off is a written document. Your housing contract is a written document. Our lives are already written. This is simply an opportunity for you to take control of that writing, and therefore an aspect of your life.
Just like before, this is a moment you are required to build an Amendment to the syllabus. You now have some context for your experience in the course, and may have a firmer grasp on what may benefit you as we move into the last unit of the course. Moving forward, there will be less take-home work as well, so this may be an opportunity for you to put that work into something other than completing work due right now, like the opportunities available to you for extra credit.
Instructions
Follow the instructions in the syllabus to create an amendment to the syllabus
Grading Criteria
You will be graded on whether you successfully complete the requirements to create an amendment to the syllabus. "
Tanisha Neely,Writing Assignment: Rhetorical Inquiry,5.0,0.006157635467980296,0.0,2020-11-13 01:01:01.000001,"Purpose
You may or may not know that we just finished a presidential election. As such, you've been for the last year or more likely inundated by political advertisements, news, ""horserace journalism,"" and other forms of communication with a wide range of purposes. While we often think of political advertisements as an attempt to persuade an audience's vote, that is not always the real purpose behind these ads. For this assignment, I want you to investigate, among other things, what the ""underlying purpose"" of these ads are.
During this class, we have utilized a particular approach to uncovering the ""underlying purpose"" of various types of communication that seem to have a clear, overt purpose. Most notably, we looked at maps and determined that, despite their reputation of communicating factual information in an objective manner, maps have an underlying purpose that may be, as we discussed with Lynne Colbert form the Mother Theresa Hackelmeier Library, factually true, but functionally either ambiguous or outright false. An example are the maps that placed the Crimea either firmly in the control of Russia or the Ukraine, when the reality is that this territory is in a fuzzy in-between state right now. We noted that for these maps, no one had consulted the actual people who live and work and spend their lives there. We noted that for these maps, there was no possibility offered of a ""neither"" option, but a forced dichotomy between these two powers. And we noted that this map seeks to uphold a concept called the ""nation-state,"" which is the preferred governmental style of our era, but which has not always existed and almost certainly will cease to exist sometime in human or world history. Which brings us to the approach we utilized: Critical Inquiry.
Critical Inquiry breaks down into the process of asking incisive questions about a piece of communication to look beneath the text. It helps us to see not what it purports to accomplish on its surface, but what it accomplishes in reality. It is one of more than a few methods of accomplishing this task, such as the CRAPP method discussed with Lynne.
A refresher on the Critical Inquiry process we utilized in class. To follow this process, you'll need to answer three questions:

Who gets to speak in this piece/who is silenced?
What perspectives are offered here/which are ignored?
What ideologies are presented here/which are ignored or outright demonized?

A refresher on the CRAPP Test:
Currency: How timely is the information, and how does its timing relate to its purpose?

Relevance: Are the assertions of the communication actually applicable to what it is asking of you?

Authority: Who is the speaker/author of this communication, and are they likely to actually be able to effectively speak on this situation? Do they have the necessary training or knowledge to interpret and communicate not only factually true, but functionally true information on this subject in this instance? Do they have motivation to provide you with information that my be either factually or functionally untrue?

Accuracy: Does the author/speaker of this communication have a reputation for truth? Is the information supported by the evidence, and can you verify it in multiple locations from multiple, credible locations? Does the language seem consistent with not only factual, but functional truth? Are there any spelling, typographic, or grammatical errors (not just non-standard English, but actual errors)? Is this a disputed claim by reputable persons? Is there context that may pose a functional challenge to this claim?

Purpose: What did you uncover in your critical inquiry that could inform both the explicit and implicit purpose of this communication? To inform? To create a strong emotional reaction like fear or anger? Are there political, ideological, cultural, religious or personal biases that you can uncover? 

If you take anything from this course, I would like you to take the ability to parse fact from fiction in communication. Importantly, when I say this, I mean not only factual truth, but functional truth. 
I want you to understand that this skill is most important not for communication you are predisposed to disagree with (that process is easy) but for information that you agree with. That is the communication you are most likely to take at face value, and therefore the information most likely to deceive you.
I want you to take this perspective out into your lives and develop your ability to utilize it for all communication that you encounter. If you begin using this process now, you will get better and better at it. Eventually, it will become easy, and even second nature. You will have honed your ability to parse information looking for that which you should trust- the most important skill of the information age.
Instructions
I want you to look at a news source where you are likely to encounter information that confirms your existing perspective. I want you, view it not just once, but three times.

On your first viewing, simply read the article or view the communication in its entirety, without any analysis. I want you to simply let it wash over you emotionally, and afterward reflect on which emotions you have experience. Write a short paragraph about this emotional reaction.
On your second viewing, read the article or view the communication and identify the claims made in the communication. A claim is a statement that is meant to be taken as fact, but provides the opportunity to be factually true (or not) and functionally true (or not). Do not analyze these claims at this time, simply list them.
On your third viewing, I want you to apply the Critical Inquiry process and the CRAAP test to a minimum of three of these claims. This should take the form of a piece of formal writing in Standard Academic English.

You will provide, in your final document, three sections to your writing.

A link to the communication you have chosen to view. I will need to be able to view this in order to provide feedback for you.
Your list of claims (minimum of three, though you should include all claims you recognize in the communication you choose).
A minimum one page analysis of, at minimum, three of the claims you have listed at the top of your document. This portion of your document should be written in Standard English.
A minimum 150 word reflection on what you learned from this assignment about evaluating sources.

Grading Criteria
While the grade for this project is solely for completion, I will be evaluating you on whether or not you include all four required pieces of this assignment and your sincere attempt to analyze a piece of communication that you agree with. Arguments such as that there is no ideology present or other types of non-effort will not be rewarded with a positive score. For you to agree with the communication, there must be ideology present. In fact, it is impossible for communication to be ideologically neutral. Claiming otherwise means you have not effectively analyzed this communication. 
How to Submit
Submit a single document that includes all four required sections."

Throughout this course we have worked with the intertwining concepts of ""home"" and ""language,"" sometimes smashed together into this idea of ""Discourse,"" ""Home Language,"" ""Englishes"" or ""Literacies."" We've delved into, ""What is Home?"" before looking into the fraught relationships around language and home, before then bursting out into how we can utilize language and writing as a means of action to remake our home in ways that we hope will benefit that home and the world. Along the way, we've learned about Naming, Show vs. Tell, Structure as a meaning-making act, Research as learning enmeshed with action, and more. We've read from successful writers who live life just a few miles from us (Maurice Broaddus, author of Buffalo Soldier, lives on Indianapolis' east side and works at Ujamaa Bookstore despite a writing career that more than keeps the lights on. Some of you may have met him there!).
Now, I want you to look back on all of those experiences I just summarized- many of which needed to be omitted for the sake of space (remember, what is not there or what is left out are just as important and meaningful as what is put in writing)- and put down in writing the ways that you have changed through this process.
This reflection is an example of Writing to Learn. I don't care if it feels messy or if there are misspellings or things don't exactly seem to pan out. What I do want to see is you thinking deeply through text about the topics we've covered and the actions we've taken in this course and how they relate back to this themes of ""home"" and ""language"" we've been exploring all semester.
TASK
This reflection should be in paragraph form, not as a sequential answer to each question. The What/How/Why questions are designed to get you thinking, not to give you a series of three separate prompts. When you're answering each of these questions, your reflective writing should flow together into a unified paragraph.
You will write a minimum of two full pages, reflecting back on the course content and the themes of ""home"" and ""language."" The reflection will be focused on concrete actions throughout the course, and how those concrete actions have led to learning and growth for you as a writer, thinker, student, and human. The reflection should focus on how your work in this class met the objectives/outcomes for the course, and ask yourself the critical questions that we have been working on throughout this class:
How have I demonstrated, through writing and class discussions, that I've grown in the following course objectives?

Substantiate ideas and statements to accomplish a purpose
Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives

Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it
Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .

Who do I/have I let speak, and whom do I/have I silenced? And why did I make those decisions in my writing and classroom discussions?
What perspectives do I/have I allowed to influence me, and what perspectives do I/have I ignored? Why did I make those decisions?
What ideological frames do I/have I allowed space in my understanding of the world, and which do I/have I ignored? Why did I make those decisions?

The ""I Am From"" poem focuses on the ways our world looks, feels, smells etc., but not just for the sake of it. It is meant to connect those things directly to who you have become. When you are thinking through the template (which you should follow for the first draft, but can absolutely stray from in subsequent drafts) helps to guide you through this process of finding things in your environment, genealogy, experience etc., translating them into sensory information, and then reflecting on the ways they have helped to build you into the person that you are today. I look forward to seeing you all work through this process!
TASK
READ
I Am From... (By Rhonda Hinkle)
I am from laundry-From Tide, Spray & Wash, and Bounce Dryer Sheets.I am from the brick ranch-red, cold, closed.I am from apple trees, sweet and rotten.I’m from Sunrise Easter Services and large noses.From Alonzo & Effie; Odius & Ruth.I’m from farming and telling others that “I got it on sale.”From “pick up your feet” and “you’re weird but you make good sandwiches” and “children are to be seen and not heard.” I’m from the United Methodists, open and loving.I’m from rural Daviess County and Irish-German heritage.Iced tea, macaroni & cheese, melons, and biscuits and gravy.From the bull that penned my Grandma Ruth by the barn, scaring the daylights out of her.The dad who caught me in the arm rather than a fish with his hook.Cedar hope chest with yellowing, musty stories from our past.
Write
Use this template to construct your own ""I Am From..."" poem: I Am From POEM TEMPLATE.pdf
TIP: Use the Padlet board from your Introduction assignment as inspiration for your poem. Likewise, if you think of something interesting for your poem, try to add a corresponding post to your Padlet board. 
Share
After you have submitted your poem, you will share your drafts in class along with some of the ideas on your Padlet board that inspired you. You will also comment on other classmates' poems something that you learned from their Introductory Padlet board. If those two projects seem to work together to help construct their identity in your mind, let them know how.
OBJECTIVES



Integrate and respond to both dominant and silenced perspectives
Create voices, roles for the reader, pathways to guide readers appropriate for the occasion
Respond critically to readings and writers

""Experienced writing instructors have long recognized that writing well means entering into conversation with others. Academic writing in particular calls upon writers not simply to express their own ideas, but to do so as a response to what others have said."" - They Say/I Say

Writing well means entering a conversation (by reading/listening/ watching), summarizing your understanding of what others have to say (they say), to set up one's own response or argument (I say). 
Demystifies academic writing, showing students ""the moves that matter"" in a language you can easily apply.
Provides easy to use templates so you make those moves in your own writing.

Read.

We also explore the idea of STRUCTURE (n) the arrangement of and relations between the parts or elements of something complex; (v) to construct or arrange according to a plan; give a pattern or organization to. ex ""the game is structured so that there are five ways to win""

This retrospective is an example of Writing to Learn and asks you to specifically ""Name what you know."" Before you begin, take some time to review this set of slides Naming What We Know: A Guide to Threshold Concepts by Nick Stanovick (also note the multimodal presentation of academic information). Allow this guide to give you some ideas about what YOU know to be true about writing that can be used in your retrospective. 
No worries if this process feels messy or if there are misspellings or things don't exactly seem to pan out. What I do want to see is you thinking deeply through text about the topics we've covered and the actions you've taken in this course and how they relate back to this theme of ""home"" and ""language"" we've been exploring all semester.

What is research? How can you use research to find actionable solutions to problems in your own home? How you can utilize ""The Advocate"" as an example of research for your own work? What is Narrative Inquiry? What is 
PURPOSE
The Advocate, on its face, is a story about a man who gave up a life in academia to take up a life of action- of putting his lack of money where his mouth was and following a calling to do more. However, I would argue that Maurice Young actually never gave up academia. He just took it to its true potential. He never gave up research, he just brought it Home. 
As we are rethinking research, I want you to do two things: First, I want you to think about what Maurice is doing and how research is an element of his work. What aspects of his advocacy (the action phas) would be impossible without first digging in, finding out, and learning? What parts of this movie (the reporting phase) would be impossible without that? Why did he choose this particular type of learning rather than another type? Second, I want you to think about yourself in relationship to Maurice's work. How does this relate to where you see yourself and the problems that you see yourself solving for your own Home?
Ultimately, I want you to come away with some strong ideas for your Community Action Research Essay
 

TASKS
Watch
The Advocate,"" is a documentary about the homeless community in Indianapolis and a man who advocated for the well-being of his home.

 
This video provides an overview of a research strategy called Narrative Inquiry. This is a strategy used by Maurice in ""The Advocate"". We will also be using this strategy in our Community Action Research.

 
This video provides a brief overview of Action Research, a process like the process we will be using in our work. Although the video is targeted at teachers, the information is just as relevant for students too.

How did watching ""The Advocate"" make you feel?
Where do you see elements of research at play? Who is researching, and for what purposes?

WHAT TO DO THIS WEEK
This week the only thing I want you to do is keep working on your Midterm Retrospectives and get feedback from your Writing Lab Instructor. If you haven't completed it yet, please get to work on it ASAP. If you have already completed it, please see my comments, and revise to improve it.
Keep in mind: This document will be the foundation for your end of semester retrospective essay (Project 4) and a critical part of your final grade. I know it isn't easy. However, it is essential that you practice naming what you know and how you know it.
Here is an example of what you can expect the Retrospective in your ePortfolio to look like: https://tneely22.wixsite.com/my-site/retrospective
If you are having a challenging time getting started, here are two sample drafts of student retrospectives that are a good start and will be excellent after revision. 
Midterm Retrospective on English 101 - Sample 1.pdf 
Midterm Retrospective on English 101 - Sample 2.pdf 
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
Naming What You Know
The retrospective is all about asking yourself what you knew about these topics and ideas BEFORE coming to this class and naming what you have learned about these ideas so far. When you name what you know, also say HOW you practiced it in class by giving examples of the assignments and activities we've done and how they connect to the ideas in the grid. You might take a scroll through our Canvas course modules to help you remember all we've done. 
For example: One of our course outcomes is for you to practice ""Listen(ing) to voices, perspectives or ideologies that you had not heard before or did not know were there to be heard.""
This is basically asking you to think about ALL the assignments and projects we've done in this course and make connections to which ones required you to practice ""Listening to voices, perspectives or ideologies that you had not heard before or did not know were there to be heard"". 
 
For example, during peer review you were required read other students work and give them feedback. Had you ever heard the voice of the person you peer reviewed? Probably not - your classmates are all new voices that offered perspectives that you had not heard before. 
 
Another example: We did in class readings, including: ""Shitty First Drafts"" by Anne Lamott. Had you ever heard of her? Had you ever heard of the idea ""Shitty First Drafts?"" If not, then you were listening to voices, perspectives or ideologies that you had not heard before or did not know were there to be heard. 
 
Keep in mind that you practiced other things while completing these assignments too. One assignment can have you practice more than one key course concept in the grid. 
Here is a short list of assignments and activities we've done in class to help you think about it:

Created Padlet boards to introduce ourselves to each other (Have you ever done this before? Thought?)
Created a Wix Website for your ePortfolio (Have you ever done this before? Thought?)
In class reading and annotation of "" The Soul Crushing Student Essay"", ""Shitty First Drafts"", ""As Soon as She Opened Her Mouth"" and ""Why Do Rich People Love Quiet."" How did the process of reading, then rereading and annotating the text help you better understand the text?)
Review of Elementary Principles of Composition | Elements of Style by William Strunk
I AM From... poem (Lots of sensory details. We followed a template to start the writing process, then built on this in the first essay.)
The House that Built Me (What languages and discourses where you influenced by?)
Adventure/Cultural Immersion Essay (Is this research?)
Midterm Retrospective (What do you think of this grid format? Does it help you organize your thoughts on paper or is it confusing?)

What Is ""Rhetorical Situation"" and Why Does it Matter Anyway? 
One of the key course outcomes for English 101 is for you to always be aware of your ""Rhetorical Situation"" so you can ""Understand your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial and language choices in your writing.""
In basic terms, rhetorical situation is all about being aware of the circumstances and conditions that contribute to what you write (or say) and how you write or say it. For example, if you are drafting an essay to receive a $5000.00 scholarship, you would consider who you are writing for; who is giving you the money and what do they value. You might even do some research to learn more about them before you write.Let's say you are writing to a family foundation who is offering scholarships to nursing students in honor of their mother who was a nurse. Let's also say that they gave you guidelines on what they wanted included in this written application. How would considering ALL of these things influence how you went about the writing process? What do you have to gain? What do you have to lose? This is essentially your ""rhetorical situation.""
Try reviewing the video we watched in class again. https://youtu.be/QE0thkr6GPA It has a lot of information, but it gives a holistic view of the writer's rhetorical situation. At the same time, I would also say: ""Don't overthink this!"" :-)

What are annotated bibliographies and why are they useful? How do I effectively summarize and quote sources in research? 
 
PURPOSE
Before you are in a position to draw relationships and make connections between your sources, you must first read and understand what those sources say. In other words, you must be able to effectively summarize your sources. Annotating and responding to sources using the They Say/I Say template is a useful strategy. Not only will it help you understand and communicate your findings, but you will also begin the first stages of the drafting process and be well on your way to writing your Community Action Research. KEEP IN MIND - everything you write here can be used in your final work.
Use the ""They Say / I Say"" template to effectively structure your summaries and quotes from sources in your annotated bibliography. To continue the process of completing your Community Action Research | Notes and Annotated Bibliography (due Sunday November 20th, 2022)

Review the details of this assignment and pay particular attention to the rubric as well as any feedback you were given about your draft. Compare your draft to the rubric and start to identify areas where you can improve so you can begin to make a revision plan. 
Sample Annotated Bibliography for Researched Narrative ENG 112 - Trophy Hunting and Conservation.docx 
Review this sample annotated bibliography written by an ENG 112 student and see my comments on what the students did well and suggestions for improvement. Keep in mind that the assignment requires you to write annotations using the They Say/ I Say template. Using the template will help you stay focused on what each stakeholder is saying and summarize their viewpoint in a neutral tone before responding with your own views.

DO: Revision Checklist
PART 1: Revise your Annotated Bibliography

Embed your meme with caption at the top of the Annotated Bibliography. See the graphic below for how to create your caption.

Write a brief introduction telling us about the meme, what it means to you and why you think this conversation is important. 
Above each source, tell us which stakeholder the source is representing. See Sample Annotated Bibliography.

Use MLA format to cite each source. 

Use the They Say / I Say template to annotate each source. DO NOT freestyle this. Use the template.

PART 2: Revise your Narrative Researched Essay
Now that you have revised your Annotated Bibliography, use it to revise your Narrative Researched Essay. Remember, almost everything you wrote in the Annotated Bibliography can be used in the essay and will keep your essay focused and well balanced. 

Give your essay a title.
Embed your meme with caption at the top of the essay.
Give a detailed description of the meme as if the reader could not see it, then explain what you think the meme is saying and the single story behind it. 
Revise the body of the essay so that you address the single story as well as the perspectives of all stakeholder. Use subtitles for each stakeholder to guide the reader and help yourself stay on topic. 

Delete all rhetorical questions - rephrase as statements if needed. 

CRITICAL: Use MLA In-Text citation when summarizing and quoting from your sources. Review MLA In-Text Citation: The Basics for guidance.

Tanisha Neely,Project 1: The Home the Built Me | Essay,0.0,0,0,,"PURPOSE
""The Home That Built Me"" is an exploration into the ways that linguistic identity, writer identity, and environment interplay.

This will be an exploration of who you are in language, and perhaps your first opportunity to look deeply at the ways that your environment and the ways you identify through language relate. These things are the water in which we swim and are therefore often completely unexamined in our lives- and that's where some connections that can be highly illuminating may be able to hide. It's your job to work toward making those connections in this assignment.

PURPOSE
“Published authors know that revision is the heart of producing effective writing…Developing writers don’t know this. They think of revising as a chore assigned because they aren’t good writers and can’t get their writing right the first time.”   –Kathleen Dudden Rowlands
Donald Murray once said that “Writing is Revising”, and I think few, if any, experienced writers would disagree with him. In my own writing, I have regularly found that a robust series of revisions to be the gatekeeper standing between dull, disorganized writing and something more interesting and clear. I have also noticed the same to be true with my students’ writing, but for a long time I struggled to get even my most committed students to see it that way. They instead tended to see revision much as Kathleen Dudden Rowlands describes above, as something that is only needed if they “mess up,” and when I asked them to revise, they almost universally responded to me in one of two ways:

They resisted and said something along the lines of “I don’t feel I need to revise/I just do one draft/I can’t find any changes to make.”  
Or they went back and quickly proofread their draft for commas, apostrophes, and other minor mechanical errors, and then handed it back as “revised.”

**********
AFTER you receive feedback from your peers as well as your Writing Lab Instructor, USE IT to make revisions to your Exploratory Draft of the Home that Built Me
While I expect this draft to be proofread and edited, this is NOT revision. I am looking for you to use the feedback your received on your exploratory draft to make MEANINGFUL changes that will improve the readers' experience of your essay.

Tanisha Neely,Adventure/Cultural Immersion Essay,100.0,0.12738853503184713,2.2929936305732483,2022-10-17 01:01:01.000001,"Overview
Writers often practice ethnography by “embedding” themselves in communities, sub-cultures, or organizations to gain a firsthand experience. An ethnography is a form of writing that uses thick description to explore a place and its associated culture. By attempting this method on a small scale, you can practice specific, focused description. 
As the title of this essay suggests, the purpose of this paper is to have an “adventure,” describe it objectively, examine its significance, and then explain or articulate what you learned from the experience. For this assignment, an adventure does not need to last long, about an hour, though it may last longer than that if necessary. You also should not need to spend any money, but again, you may choose to if an activity really appeals to you. Safety is of the utmost importance! Do not go into an unfamiliar environment where you feel unsafe!
As an ethnographer, your goal is to take in details without influencing those details. To stay focused, go to this place alone and refrain from using your phone or doing anything besides notetaking and documenting the experience through photographs, audio, or video. Keep your attention on the people and the place and practice radical noticing!

Take notes on your general impressions of the place. 
Use imagery and thick description to describe the place itself. What sorts of interactions do you observe? What sort of tone, affect, and language is used? How would you describe the overall atmosphere?
Zoom in on artifacts—specific physical objects being used by the people you see. Use imagery and thick description to describe the specific artifacts. How do these parts contribute to/differentiate from/relate to the whole of the scene?
Write an essay that synthesizes (weaves together) your observations to describe the space and culture. What do the details represent or reveal about the place and people? 

Sample Cultural Immersion Essay
 
Assignment

Embed yourself in an environment that is completely new to you. This could be as simple as taking a walk to a park, library or museum you’ve never visited. Maybe you’ve never gone bowling or eaten sushi before and want to try it. Maybe your friend has invited you to their church/temple/synagogue, and it’s part of religion that is unfamiliar to you. Try something new.
Observe and take notes about what you see, hear, smell, taste or do. What does the site look like? How many people are there? What are they doing? Do they interact with you or ignore you? Describe the experience from your own perspective. This section should be objective. Stick to the facts – no analysis or evaluation in this section. Just explain the who, what, where, and when.
Examine the experience. Why did certain things look as they did? Did certain people seem to be “regulars” at this location? How did they distinguish themselves? Did they dress a certain way? Did they have special equipment? Why did people behave as they did? This section is all about the WHY.
Articulate your Learning. What did you get out of this experience? What did you learn about people in this community or culture? What did you learn about yourself?

Your essay should include:• An introduction to the essay• Objective description of the site and the experience• Examination of the reasons certain interactions occurred/decisions were made• Explanation of what you learned• 2 Photographs, Images or short Video
Format (MLA research paper style)• Length: 3-5 pages (at least 1200 words - feature legnth), double-spaced• Font: a 12-point font of your choice; Times New Roman is a good choice.• Margins: 1"" all the way around the page.• Headings: first page MLA heading with your name, my name, course title, and date of draft; subsequent pages should have a header, right justified at the 1/2"" line with your last name and page number; the Works Cited page should be titled ""Works Cited"" (don't use quotation marks around the words Works Cited), and the works used should be listed and formatted as indicated in class. (Note: This paper should use in-text citations where appropriate and necessary and should have a Works Cited page.)• Paper title: centered, one double-space line under the first page heading.• No cover page for the paper
 
What I'll be Looking For: 
• Used the introduction to have something to say by introducing the paper’s topic • Used thick description so the audience can visualize the experience and make connections between the rhetoric of space and structure
• Examined the experience and answered the ""WHYs"" and what was learned in a significant, substantial way• Demonstrates Elementary Principles of Composition | Elements of Style by William Strunk• Used MLA documentation style to show readers from where your outside support comes (including the ads)• Formatted the paper according to MLA style

Introduce and raise awareness about a problem in your ""home"" community.
Present a solution that YOU and others can act on. 

TASK
You will create a minimum four-page research paper that will adhere to the following guidelines:



The writing must seek to introduce, and then provide some at least partial solution to, a problem that you see in your ""home"" that you plan to take an active part in.
The writing must include reference to ""assets"" that this community has, and seek to utilize them within the solution
The writing must include references to ""needs"" that this community has and how they relate to the problem/solution
The writing must demonstrate the ways that you will be involved in implementing this solution. This should be a realistic solution to a problem that you have the capacity to be a part of the change. And you can be a part of solving huge problems, if you can identify your role in solving them.
The writing must demonstrate the ways that research will be an ongoing component of discovering and implementing your solution. See the Action Research and/or Narrative Inquiry videos earlier for guides on what these research processes can look like, and ""The Advocate"" for a model on what this can look like in practice out in the real world.
The writing must include a minimum of four citations in MLA format, following the guidelines below:

A minimum of one scholarly citation such as a journal article, book, or study
A minimum of one CREDIBLE popular citation such as a newspaper article, newscast or some other credible form of collecting and distributing information with the community.
Encouraged inclusion of primary resources such as interviews with community members, direct observations, tweet by a neighbor, Facebook post from a community page or someone directly impacted or working on the problem, etc.





The writing's format must adhere to the following guidelines:



Begin with an Introduction that will inform the reader of what types of information they are about to read, characterizes the community and their assets/needs, etc.
Include a discussion of the problem that identifies the problem itself and how it manifests within the community. This should emerge directly from your research question and include citations that help the reader to understand the problem and its context.
Include a discussion of the solution that identifies the actions the author will take, personally and communally, to help to resolve the problem, how you are involved, and how research can play an ongoing role in the solution.
End with a conclusion that wraps up the big ideas and helps the reader to understand the totality of the writing
Be in MLA format

Adventure/Cultural Immersion Essay (1000-1200 Words including 2 Photos)
Community Action Research (1000-1200 Words)
Retrospective: Write 1-2 strongly written paragraphs naming what you know and how you know it for EACH objective in the grid. Make sure that when you make a claim about your learning, you support it with evidence of the work you did in class and essential practices.

PURPOSE
The Final Portfolio is a chance for you to demonstrate the ways that you've applied what we've learned in class to your writing projects and showcase your work and growth throughout the entire course.
As we've discussed many times in class, the measure of a writer is not how cleanly they can get words down on paper the first try, but the process by which they move from concept to polish. The best writers, in other words, are not those who can vomit most efficiently onto the page, but those who are the most tenacious, stick with it the longest, apply their learning, and come to a final product conscious and confident of its eventual impact on the audience. This portfolio is a chance for you to show that trait in yourself through your writing and its growth.
***
This portfolio's intent is outlined in the course syllabus, and is meant to demonstrate your ability aligning with the following General Education Objectives:
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes
5.1 The ability to communicate and interpret meaning in a range of situations, for a range of purposes;
And Course Outcomes:
a. Use creative techniques to create insights into personal experiences;
b. Compose documents for academic and non-academic audiences;
c. Integrate multiple perspectives about a problem that shows your understanding of significant and relevant issues when analyzing and explaining it;
d. Reflect on your ability to make informed and effective research, genre, editorial, and language choices in your writing .
***
You have, throughout this course, been asked to interpret meaning from different information mediums like text, audio, video and image, as well as a range of information presentation types from maps to articles to documentaries. You've been asked to communicate within a range of purposes, from informative research to inquiry to opinion to persuasion, within a wide variety of genres. 
You have been asked to utilize various techniques discussed in class such as showing/telling, naming and structure, as well as a range of evidence strategies from emotional/logical to anecdotal to communal to scholarly. Your audiences have been both academic and non-academic, they have required multiple perspectives and critical inquiry into who benefits/is left out, who gets to speak/is silenced, and what ideologies are present/ignored. And, through your reflective writing and reading strategies we've learned, you've been asked to reflect on how these writings bear upon your ideas of research, language choices, writing, and our ever constant theme of ""home.""
We've been working on this all semester working up to this revision-focused portfolio, and you are now prepared to demonstrate that learning.

GRADING CRITERIA
There are 100 total points available for the Final Portfolio, broken up into 5 categories of 20 points each. These categories follow the values set forth by your instructor from the very beginning of the course.
20 Points for Process
 I should be able to look back at your Draft 1 of each of your works and see a concerted effort and movement in each of the pieces. Evidence that you've tried out new things and made significant effort to see where your writing can take you in developing your piece toward its final draft is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
20 Points for Rhetorical Effectiveness
I should be able to see the meaning that you are working toward, and see the ways that the choices you've made in writing are meant to lead your intended audience toward your purpose. This is the does your writing do what you want it to criteria. Evidence that your writing has a clear purpose, intended audience, and follows the expectations of that audience in ways that are beneficial to effectively ""moving"" them is necessary to receive full credit in this category.
20 Points for Structural Soundness
I should be able to see that you are intentionally utilizing structure as a meaning-making tool. While readability is absolutely a top-notch concern here, for full credit in this category I want to see that the sentence, paragraph, page etc. structure you've chosen is a conscious- not unconscious- method of ""moving"" your audience in line with your purpose.
20 Points for Linguistic Choice and Efficacy
This absolutely does not mean that you must use *Standard English in your writing. What it does mean is that the linguistic choices that you make- from Naming to Show vs Tell to the use of that ""other"" language in your writing like ands, buts, thoughs, howevers etc. are conscious- not unconscious- choices meant to ""move"" your audience in line with your purpose.
20 Points for Response to Prompt
To receive full credit in this category, each piece must effectively respond to the prompt in its entirety. This does not always mean direclty answering every question in the prompt. It does, however, mean writing along the subject lines the prompt asks for, writing in the genre the prompt asks for, and following any guidelines set forth by the prompt.
